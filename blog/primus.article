            <h3>Stepping Forward</h3>
            <p>The more that I look at the discourse on Facebook, the less I like it. It is in general superficial and error-prone, and there is little keeping it going besides a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/05/network-effects-and-global-domination-the-facebook-strategy/" target="_blank">network effect</a> - it's where the people are. This is the sort of benefit that is hard to combat <em>en masse</em>, and is a problem that I'm going to leave for people who are smarter than me. One notable exception is the proliferation in the instant messaging space of <a href="https://discordapp.com/company" target="_blank">Discord</a> for creating small servers, and decentralizing (or at least fragmenting) the <a href="https://www.messenger.com/about">Messenger</a> IM monoculture.</p>
            <p>That being said, I'm tired, I don't have to put up with this, and I'm done sitting idly. My plan is to adopt the <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE" target="_blank">Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere</a> strategy for content creation. All the new musings will be posted here, and cross-pollinated to my other media. I may or may not embed a comment section, but I will always be reachable via email (see the <a href="#bottom-text">footer</a>).</p>
            <p>As part of this commitment, I also offer anyone reading this the same opportunity: if you are interested in blogging and would like a (reasonably sized) web space to put your stuff, email me, and I'll share my space. Long live the decentralized web!</p>
