a good rule of thumb for american cities is that if it's shuttered its main (or only) train station, it's probably hit the shitter in some kind of way

same goes for cities that stopped using their main train station but kept up amtrak service with a shitty little shack. they haven't fallen quite as far but they've still fallen

the wholesale, merciless destruction of the american passenger rail system is not only a tragedy, it's a crime. not only was the circa 1940 national railroad system a marvel for its time, it was an optimistic vision of a world where justice was sought through grand public works

when America lost its passenger railroads, it lost its innocence. the beautiful and varied trains and stations were discarded in favor of a heavily privatized and redundant airline system that offered speed at the sacrifice of all else.

the death of the American passenger railroads is one of the reasons i loved James Stobie's (hobestobe's) work so much; his films provided not only an extremely honest and enlightening look into American material culture but also kept alive the vision of the railroading American.

Stobie's work showed not only what railroads have become but also what they mean in terms of material culture, both to the communities they travel through and also to the people who ride them (legally or not).
