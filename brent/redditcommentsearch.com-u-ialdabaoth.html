 Sunflower roots produce sugar, alcohol, and biofuel. "Sunroots" can be 
eaten by people and livestock. Sunroots are prebiotic with bioactive 
medicinal compounds demonstrating antifungal, antioxidant, and 
anticancer properties. They grow in drought, poor soil and resist pests,
 disease, and fungus.</a>                  </h4>                  <br>                  <div class="container">                  <div class="md"><p>Paid for by the National Sunflower Council.</p>

<p>There is always a non-zero probability of a child wandering into your
 space while you are performing sexual acts. If you want to reduce the 
chance of this to zero, become perfectly asexual.</p>

<p>There is always a non-zero probability of law enforcement finding 
something you are doing objectionable. If you want to reduce the chance 
of this to zero, don't live where there are laws.</p>

<p>Other than that, look at the actual probability of someone of your 
race, gender, socioeconomic background, etc. getting in trouble for 
doing the things you're doing, based on the level of exposure, and then 
adjust your level of exposure until you're as comfortable as you can be.
 (This may not always work, of course - plenty of people get arrested 
for doing things they weren't even doing, because they have the wrong 
race/class/socioeconomic background and their mere existence is 
effectively illegal - but in general most people into BDSM are white and
 hetero, so I think statistically my advice still stands.)</p>

<p>Would a normal person reasonably expect to encounter you and your partner? </p>

<p>Example: people can reasonably expect to do what they want in their 
own house. Thus, people can reasonably expect their neighbors to do what
 their neighbors want, in their neighbors' house. Thus, people can 
reasonably expect to encounter signs of their neighbors doing things.</p>

<p>People can't reasonably expect to do anything that they want in a 
public park. Rules of decency, decorum, etc. will shift depending on the
 environment. So a known 'nude beach' might have different expectations 
of decorum than a place where children typically frequent. And parents 
in our culture, for good or ill, can typically expect 'child-friendly' 
spaces to exclude overt sexual behavior. </p>

<p>So, let's say you have a thing for going out into the woods and tying
 your girl up. How much should you prevent people from stumbling in? 
That's an excellent question, and different people actually have 
different answers to it. You have the right to enjoy nature, and so do 
other people, and somewhere in the interface between those rights, you 
(as the acting party with the less-common desired behavior) need to 
figure out where to set the bar. </p>

<ul>
<li>constructing and maintaining the Yurtery (we have yurtage for 35 people)</li>
<li>construction and maintenance of our attractions (we have a 24 foot 
diameter geodesic sphere that sits inside a 50 foot diameter lotus 
flower, with moving petals that light up; we're also working on an LED 
dance floor this year)</li>
<li>construction and maintenance of our shade structure (we have two 
geodesic domes, one of which is covered in RMAX panels and 
climate-controlled, as well as a 30'x40'x10' kitchen)</li>
<li>construction and maintenance of our power system (we have 3 
kilowatts of solar panels, with enough batteries to maintain a total 
output of 1.6 kilowatts 24/7)</li>
<li>food (we bring half of a bison, plus enough dry foods to feed 35 
people, plus ice cream and otter pops, all in two large chest freezers)</li>
<li>water (we bring almost 300 gallons of water)</li>
<li>sanitation (we contract with USS to pump out our greywater)</li>
<li>transport (we own and maintain a 16 foot box truck, and rent three passenger vans to transport our people to playa)</li>
</ul>

<p>We also offer people a 50% discount on camp dues if they come to 
build week and help set up everything, or a 100% discount if they come 
to build week <em>AND</em> participate in the actual building and 
maintenance of infrastructure during the months leading up to the burn 
(although most of those people tend to contribute a few thousand dollars
 anyways, so the line between "donations" and "dues" gets kinda 
blurred.)</p>

<p>One important thing for us is, we DO discuss the internal finance 
details. At length. Joining our camp puts you front and center to the 
mess, and you will hear all the crazy details. </p>

<p>Anyone who can't break down what the money is spent on is just scamming you.</p>

promise I really want X and am not being coerced", and then starting to 
do X, and then being told "I never consented to you doing X, and if I 
SAID I consented, I was coerced."</p>

<p>I'm completely okay with people changing their mind. I'm not okay with people <em>retroactively</em>
 changing their story, because they're too ashamed of who they were

<p>If you meta-consent to this, expect to have mixed feelings about your meta-consent later.</p>

<p>Expect to NOTICE all the ways you could get back at your boyfriend, 
and fuck him over socially/legally/emotionally, after he does this.</p>

<p>Expect parts of you to experience it as "too real", and need to 
inflict emotional injury on him for having done it to you, while other 
parts of you experience it as "not real enough", and need to inflict 
emotional injury on him for having not given you exactly what you 
wanted.</p>

<p>In short, realize that you're putting him into far more danger than he's putting you into.</p>

Here's some useful information, if you want to save metal (reposted from my Facebook):</p>

<p>Have you ever thought about building your own geodesic dome? From scratch?</p>

<p>Here's some fun facts for you!</p>

<p>First, domes come in different patterns. For some reason, people call
 these patterns "frequencies", and designate them with a 'V'. A dome's 
"frequency" is the number of times that the edges of an icosohedron (or 
'D20' for you Dungeons and Dragons nerds) has been subdivided to make it
 more spherical. So a "Frequency 1" or "V1" dome is just a D20, while a 
V2 dome is a D20 with each edge cut in the middle, a V3 dome is a D20 
with each edge cut into 3 equal segments, a V4 dome is a D20 with each 
edge cut into 4 equal segments, and so on.</p>

<p>The higher the frequency of the dome, the more "spherical" it is, and
 thus the sturdier it is - but also the more tubes you need.</p>

<p>Generally, you make these tubes by going down to the local hardware 
store, buying steel pipe called "EMT conduit", cutting it down to size, 
hammering the edges flat, and then drilling holes in the flat edges, and
 then spray painting the edges different colors based on the distance 
between the drilled holes. Then you build your sphere by pushing bolts 
through those holes and tightening nuts onto the bolts to hold 
everything together.</p>

<p>It turns out that, for economic reasons, a tube length of about five 
feet is generally what you want. This is because you can buy EMT tubes 
at ten foot lengths, and then cut them about in half to make two 
five-foot tubes. You could <em>also</em> cut them in thirds to make 
three three-ish foot tubes, or leave them uncut for ten-foot tubes, but 
three foot tubes make really small spheres, and ten foot tubes aren't 
strong enough to hold up against the kind of forces that can be exerted 
along their length when putting the sphere together. So generally five 
feet is the sweet spot, plus or minus a few inches.</p>

<p>Which actually gives you a maximally efficient size for each dome 
frequency! Since each frequency has a set pattern of lengths, you can 
"line up" short lengths with long lengths, to get one short and one long
 length out of each 10' EMT tube.</p>

<p>Now, I've been working on <em>spheres</em>, while domes are basically
 slightly-more-than-half of a sphere (more than half because you need 
the full equatorial ring). So all the numbers you're about to hear are 
for a full geodesic sphere, which is more fun anyways. Everything here 
assumes 1/2" drill holes, and 1/8" tolerances. (You don't really need 
better than 1/8" tolerances, given how wiggly all the metal is anyways.)</p>

<p>EMT conduit pipes are about $5 each for "3/4 inch diameter piping" 
(which is actually almost an inch in real diameter, so go figure), or 
about $9 each for "1 inch diameter piping" (which is actually about an 
inch and a quarter in real diameter... it's a trend). I'd probably 
recommend the thicker pipe if you can swing it, especially for the 
bigger domes. So you're looking at anywhere from a little over $500 for a
 16 foot diameter 2V sphere, to a little over $5,000 for a nearly fifty 
foot around 6V.</p>

<p>My Burning Man camp, Black Lotus, currently has a 12 foot radius (24 
foot diameter) 3V sphere, which is pretty impressive to look at. We 
throw a trampoline inside it and some aerial silks, and play around. If 
you're in the Bay Area and part of my social group, you probably got to 
play inside it during our last Rationalist Summer Solstice party, which I
 mostly used as an excuse to test the sphere equipment before dragging 
it out to Black Rock City two months later. I'm debating building a 
bigger 5V or even 6V sphere next year, and turning the 3V sphere into a 
pair of domes to house smaller stuff in. But we'll see what kinds of 
funding and manpower I have to throw at that dream.</p>

 In 1918, there was an outbreak of the 'Spanish Flu'. This was during 
WW1 and many countries had limits on what the press could write about, 
except Spain who was neutral. Thus, more reports came out about the flu 
from Spain causing people to think it was just happening there.</a>                  </h4>                  <br>                  <div class="container">                  <div class="md"><p>Breakdown:</p>

<p>A virus is basically just a strand of DNA or RNA, encased in a 
protein sheath. If the DNA gets inside a cell, the cell mistakes it for 
its own DNA, and follows its instructions - which involve copying the 
virus DNA a bunch of times, building each copy a new protein sheath, and
 then politely killing itself to let the new virus copies out.</p>

<p>One part of that DNA is the part that lets it actually bind to cells.
 In Influenza, there are 18 variants of the stick-to-cells code inside 
the DNA - they're labeled H1 through H18. ('H' stands for 
'hemagglutinin' which literally means "stick to (glutin -&gt; glue) 
blood (hema)". So H5 is a particular version of the stick-to-cells code,
 which codes for a particular kind of protein glue; H1 is a different 
kind of glue that apparently works a lot better, hence making the virus 
more lethal.</p>

<p>(EDIT: All of this is true, except that influenza is a retrovirus, 
which means its RNA instead of DNA. Doesn't change any of the mechanics 
though.)</p>

 One of the big problems here, is that the people with all the power in 
this situation (the father and daughter) are not the people who are 
suffering the consequences (the bf). The daughter could choose to take 
power to shift who's suffering the consequences, but that would take 
owning up to her contribution to the situation.</p>

<p>Ultimately, since the father and daughter are both pretty well-off, 
no one is really incentivized to make sure the (now ex-)bf doesn't get 
screwed, so I anticipate the ex-bf will just get screwed. Which will 
probably fuck him up for life, but hey - he's not rich, so who cares.</p>

<p>I run a veeerrrry slow King Crab with quad Light Gauss Rifles. When I
 can get into position, it becomes a lynchpin of the team - I'm drawing 
fire from 6+ enemy mechs at once, all of whom are too busy focusing on 
me to deal with the brawlers - or, they focus on the brawlers and I 
shred them from a kilometer away. </p>

<p>But I'm not just waiting for other people to call targets for me; I'm
 usually using my sniper position to be the one calling the targets. I 
pop whoever pokes their head out until they back off behind cover, 
giving my team sufficient suppressing fire to advance. If redteam tries 
to stop the advance, they expose themselves to my gauss rifles, and I 
tear through their side torsos in seconds. If they focus on me, they get
 slammed into by my team.</p>

<p>The thing is, this requires that my team stop bitching about the fact that I'm in the back, and <em>fucking get in there and push when I say push</em>.
 I'm in a good position to see what the enemy team is doing; they need 
to trust me when I say "they're all looking at me, go go go".</p>

<p>Otherwise I get picked apart by 8+ enemy mechs and my team still gets decimated because no one uses the opportunity to push.</p>

<p>It's totally fine with most people if you're a Dom who prefers 
inexperienced subs. It's even fine if you're a Dom that prefers 
inexperienced subs specifically because you want to prey on their 
vulnerability.</p>

<p>JUST DON'T FUCKING ADMIT IT. We like to protect our predators, 
because the qualities and skills that make a successful predator also 
make a successful leader (knowing how to make people feel comfortable 
with you, knowing how to maintain your public reputation, and so on) - 
and we'd rather have leaders that make us feel good about them. It means
 we can rely on our feelings instead of actually having to spend a lot 
of effort paying attention to what people are doing.</p>

<p>So yeah, do what you want, just remember to manage what you <em>look</em> like and you'll be fine.</p>

levels 17-20. Expertise adds an additional Proficiency die. A "critical

'1', while a 'critical success' happens whenever the D20 itself rolls a 
20.</p></li>

<p>With those caveats:</p>

<p>A) AWALT is a pre-commitment, not a statement about reality.</p>

<p>What this means is, it is important for game-theoretic reasons to <em>BEHAVE</em>
 as if AWALT, even though, statistically, some women will be more "like 
that" than others. There's obviously a spectrum of behavior, and it's 
actually theoretically possible to find a so-called "unicorn"; it's just
 that statistically, you aren't going to. More importantly, it's very 
easy to for a girl to FAKE being a unicorn, and VERY costly for a guy to
 mistake a fake unicorn for a real one, and so given the probabilities, 
it is virtually NEVER worth the gamble to trust one's senses that a 
given girl is a unicorn.</p>

<p>But that often gets rounded off to "unicorns don't exist", which is 
in fact statistically implausible. Given variations in g, OCEAN 
personality traits, etc., and three billion women, there's going to be 
maybe five or six out there. But since they're so valuable, there's 
going to be another few hundred million women PRETENDING to be unicorns,
 which means a ratio of about a hundred million fakes per one real. So 
unless your detector has a false positive rate a hundred million times 
lower than your false negative rate, you ain't gonna win that game.</p>

<p>But that's different, epistemically, from a face-value reading of AWALT.</p>

<p>B) Redpill is amoral, but <a href="https://redditcommentsearch.com/r/redpill">r/redpill</a>
 often explicitly embraces the "enjoy the decline" ethical stance. 
Civilization-building, and creating value in general, is not ALWAYS a 
fool's game; it's just PROBABLY a fool's game for YOU, in your 
particular time and place, with your particular talents. But the kind of
 people you'll run into on SSC are far more invested in the 
value-creation side of "beta mindset" than redpill advocates, and I 
think they actually see something real.</p>

<p>My general explanation of redpill to the community that SSC is a part
 of is "these guys are more correct than anyone else about the facts, 
but generally pretty awful when it comes to values."</p>

make her enjoy it then she WANTS to be able to call it assault.</p>

<p>And that seems pretty terrifying to me, because it seems like lately,
 most of the people I'm actually attracted to have this mindset, and I 
don't know how to navigate it. </p>

 I'm about 90% finished with a lite Dungeon Crawler, similar to Descent:
 Journeys in the Dark or Super Dungeon Explore or Warhammer Quest, but 
with a slightly lighter, exception-based ruleset.</p>

<p>Like Warhammer Quest, there's no dedicated DM. Monsters and traps are
 controlled entirely by decks of 'Tactics' and 'Event' cards, which 
determine who the monsters attack, and whether treasure chests or doors 
or hallways are trapped. Each player gets to play a hero.</p>

<p>Like Descent, character classes are decks of Feat cards, each of 
which are purchasable through experience. Different characters will 
qualify for different classes based on their stats.</p>

<p>Combat attacks are always handled by 2D6, with special dice (vaguely 
similar to Descent's dice, but you never roll more or less than 2). 
Defense is a static value or a static value + a special 1D6.</p>

<p>There's a crafting system, whereby players can hand-pick items out of the Treasure deck if they have the prerequisite materials.</p>

<p>The default setting has heroes exploring the vast ancient ruins of a 
magitech civilization, looking for priceless artifacts that their home 
villages or kingdoms need. However, the game system itself will be 
semi-open-sourced, so that anyone is allowed to publish and sell their 
own settings and adventure modules.</p>

<p>After the first sessions of playtesting, it looks like average dungeon crawl should take about half an hour to 45 minutes.</p>

<p>My biggest current design problem is that I literally can't think of a
 name. I'd rather not reference any particular in-setting names, because
 I want it generic (since it'll be a modular system), but I still need 
something catchy.</p>

<p>Here's the current cards; layout and icon graphics are all done, but all the character art is placeholder for now:</p>

Well, I brawl.</p>

<p>All my assault LRM builds are set up to do LRM damage during the 
first 3-5 minutes of the engagement, while the Kodiaks and the Atlases 
tank. Then my LRMs run out, and I wade in with full armor and a pair of 
UAC-5s or a blister of Large Pulses, and let the other damaged assaults 
take a breather. LRM early -&gt; brawl late is a reasonably effective 
strategy down in T4, where you can't really rely on your team to have 
experience or a coherent strategy.</p>

<p>Also, there's a big difference between Stalker 5xLRM15 shenanigans, 
and King Crab 3xLRM5 shenanigans. If I'm going all in with a Stalker, 
I'm not just spreading useless damage around; I'm stripping large chunks
 of armor off the rabbits your idiot Alpha Lance would otherwise be 
chasing into a trap. Whereas with a King Crab, my job isn't even to do 
the damage; it's to keep the enemy CERLL snipers too busy and distracted
 to core your CT from 800 meters away. At which point, I actually don't 
even care if I hit; I just care that the enemy is spending too much time
 finding cover to actually coordinate into a deathball.</p>

<p>And remember, we're talking about a 10-ton commitment on my King 
Crab, tops. When I get bored of 4xUAC5, and frustrated trying to make 
2xAC20+4xSRM6 work, fuck yeah I'm gonna dive in with 3xLRM5 and some 
LPLs and MGs. Because it's <em>fun</em>, and I'm here to watch big stompy robots blow up, not win some competitive trophy.</p>

<p>(Also, maybe 4xUAC5 would be more fun more often if you idiot Thunderbolt pilots would stop <em>diving in front of me</em> every time I open up, then scream at me about the backshots.)</p>

<p>1a. There will always be someone better than you. If you're in their way and they notice you, you're fucked.</p>

<p>1b. There will always be someone worse than you. If they're in your 
way and you notice them, and you decide to be merciful, do NOT assume 
that this will buy you any kind of reprieve from the next time 1a is 
relevant.</p>

 I was 17, a bunch of girls made up a fake 12 year old girl (as in the 
'victim' didn't even exist) and reported me to the police, police showed
 up to question me, my parents believed them, it turned out that the 
victim was made up and the police knew it, my parents refused to believe
 that that's what happened, so they grounded me for a year and brought 
it up whenever they wanted to fuck with me about anything (like me 
wanting to go away to college).</p>

<p>So my GENERAL assumption is that girls, the authorities, and my 
family and friends will all agree to a known and obvious lie if it means
 they get more power over me or can make me suffer. In my gut, I know I 
am never safe, no one is ever on my side, and everything I care about 
and everything I work for can be taken away from me in an instant, for 
no reason, and there will never, ever, be anything I can do about it,

<p>There's <em>tons</em> of cutting-edge psych research that will walk 
you through how to game people, and how to not be gamed. Businesses pay 
big bucks for that. If you're going to go ahead and get a 4 year degree,
 you may as well spend some of that money signalling that you know those
 skills - even if you actually picked them up outside the classroom.</p>

<p>On that note, here's a partial reading list for people who want a better user's manual for your (and other people's) brain:</p>

 which is why I'm building an environment where learning inner game

<p>Then when you graduate, emphasize that you took psych courses to 
understand social intrusion techniques, and leverage yourself into a 
more senior position from the get-go. </p>

<p>Also, if you're 25, and you're going to a state school with a bunch 
of 18 to 22 year olds, leverage that. Take an Intro to Java class, then 
get a DBA-level business license and set up a consulting business. Find 
some good six week long projects that will pay $50 an hour, then hire 19
 year old CSE students who are just starting out in Java classes. Tell 
him you'll <em>pay</em> him $20 an hour to tutor him, when really all 
you're doing is letting him do all the schlepp work and correcting his 
rookie mistakes and pocketing half the money. (This works best if your 
college has Java classes with an end-of-semester final project - you set
 it up so that your student's project <em>is</em> the actual deliverable to the client, which will impress the hell out of the teacher.)</p>

<p>Everyone wins.</p>

out of college to join a tech startup are outperforming the guys who

<p>I got in the door at my last gig before this one because I wrote mods
 for Kerbal Space Program, and my boss's son played that game, so I was 
instantly more than just some guy with a degree from a random college - I
 was the guy that kept his son entertained and educated for hundreds of 
hours. And it didn't matter that I only wrote a tiny bit of code for the
 game, he anchored me to his son being happy, and bam - I've got the

 fuck that. I don't have a degree and I'm glad I don't. Most of the kids
 around me with CS degrees don't know how to problem-solve. They know 
algorithms, they know something they call UX design, but they don't know
 how to figure out the right solution to the problem.</p>

<p>You want to learn to program? Fucking learn to program. It's just 
like lifting but for your brain. Go download some open video game like 
Kerbal Space Program, set up a github account, and start coding. Once 
you've proven that you can do something useful, download an Android dev 
kit and build yourself your own mobile app. </p>

<p>You don't need some shitty 4 year degree to 'prove' that you can 
code. I spent 10 years as a tech lead, and I will tell you that if you 
come to me with an app that <em>works</em> and does something <em>useful</em>, and you walk me through the trickiest part of the function library, and I will fucking hire you on the spot, no interview.</p>

<p>And anywhere that needs to ask you bullshit algorithm questions after
 vetting your CSE credentials isn't a place you want to work for, 
anyways.</p>

challenge is stupid and you should feel bad, I saved this company $3 
million dollars so unless you can pony up that much cash, you have to 
back down and eat shit for challenging my initiative". That gets 
people's attention.</p>

<p>(Obviously don't SAY "back down and eat shit" unless you're in some 
boiler room money market firm; most companies reward people who 'play

It takes a weird combination of empathy and cynicism.</p>

<p>So, first, a parable:</p>

<p>There was this research project involving monkeys. Research projects 
involving monkeys are usually awesome and hilarious just by themselves, 
but this one also produced a super important result. But first, the 
awesome and hilarious setup: </p>

<p>Shove a bunch of monkeys in a room, put a bunch of bananas hanging 
from the ceiling, stick a ladder under the bananas, point a fire hose at
 the ladder. Whenever monkeys start to climb the ladder to get at the 
bananas, hose every motherfucking monkey down with the firehose, whether
 they were on the ladder or not.</p>

<p>Predictably, the monkeys will start beating the shit out of any 
monkey that goes near the ladder, no matter how hungry they all are.</p>

<p>Now, feed them some kibble and repeat. Do this a few times until the 
monkeys have all got it fully ingrained into monkey culture that ladder =
 beating. Then disconnect the hose.</p>

<p>The monkeys don't know the hose is disconnected, of course, so they 
keep beating the shit out of any monkey that goes near the ladder.</p>

<p>Swap out a monkey for a fresh monkey, one that never got hosed. 
What's he do? He makes a bee line for the ladder, because hey! Bananas! 
(The scientists DID remember to throw out the old nasty-ass bananas and 
put up fresh ones.) What do the other monkeys do? beat the shit out of 
him, of course.</p>

<p>Next day, swap out ANOTHER old hose-monkey for a fresh non-hosed 
monkey. What's he do? Beeline for the ladder! What do they do? Beat the 
shit out of him!</p>

<p>Repeat this process until there isn't a SINGLE monkey in the pack who EVER got the hose. And then, put in a new monkey.</p>

<p>They STILL beat the shit out of him. Why? Because "that's how we do it here!"</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>What's the point of that lesson?</p>

<p>When you look around you in an office, you'll see a LOT of stuff 
that's just... stupid. Stuff that makes no goddamn sense, wastes money, 
and makes everyone miserable.</p>

<p>Some of that stuff is there because someone's got a hose pointed at 
the office, and will punish everyone if they try to make an improvement.
 </p>

<p>But OTHER stuff is there because, a long time ago, someone USED to 
have a hose pointed at the office, but they're long gone - and still, 
the monkeys beat up anyone that could get them the bananas, because 
"that's how we do things around here."</p>

<p>Learn to say "fuck that" and pay attention.</p>

<p>Sometimes someone has a hose pointed at everybody for a good reason -
 maybe some improvements actually come at a steep cost somewhere else in
 the organization - but more often than not it's just because someone 
wants to make a dick-print on the office environment and has the power 
to do so. Trust me, you don't wanna cross those guys.</p>

<p>But again, sometimes there's just... no reason to do the dumb thing anymore. </p>

<p>So learn to keep your eyes open, and notice all the little things 
that could be improved, and then look a step deeper and notice all the 
things that actually CAN be improved without your ass getting fired for 
trying.</p>

<p>And then come in and do one of them. There's this dog-and-pony show 
where you have to do some kind of analysis and "show your work" and make
 it look like you're doing it for your boss, but if you just <em>do it</em>
 you can often just fucking wing that part. The real analysis you need 
is in cost savings - be able to PROVE that the change you made saved the
 company money, and someone with a high six-figure salary will notice 
you. Do it with a minimum of personal effort, and you've just bought a 
ticket out of loserdom.</p>

<p>I'd strongly recommend reading Venkatesh Rao's "Gervais Principle" 
stuff before trying any of this, though, and cross-correlating with the 
relevant bits from "The 48 Laws of Power". </p>

<p>Let's say you've found that perfect woman, who's fallen completely in love with you and wants to stay with you "forever".</p>

<p>Great!</p>

<p>But that's who she is <em>RIGHT NOW</em>. It's not a lie, it's not a deception, it's not even "hamsterwheeling" <em>per se</em> - although it likely will be later. What it is, right now, is her.</p>

<p>The mistake people make is thinking that "her" is some immutable 
thing, instead of a product of her current body, her current habits, and
 her current environment.</p>

<p>Lemme put this a different way, for those of you who don't want to give up on LTR: the effort of <em>getting</em> a woman is nothing compared to the effort of <em>keeping</em>
 her. (And if you don't think that effort is worth it, fucking awesome -
 you go do you, and I don't blame you one bit. But if you find that it <em>is</em> worth it, intrinsically, then maybe all my pontificating can help.)</p>

<p>This is why the "Captain and First Mate" dynamic is so important - 
you HAVE to maintain an environment where YOU are her best option. 
Because the moment her environment contains options that look better 
than you, guess what's going to happen?</p>

<p>And you can mitigate that by adjusting her habits - getting her to 
not look so readily, or to find things to be dissatisfied. But that's 
not a conscious process; that's itself a product of the environment that
 <em>you</em> shape.</p>

<p>Radical self-ownership is scary. It's scary because EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU IS YOUR FAULT.</p>

<p>Which means that if she left you, you have no one else to blame. Especially not her - no matter how tempting it might be.</p>

<p>Because she was a body, with habits, in an environment - and this is 
what happened. You want something different to happen? Build her a 
different environment. Teach her new habits. Help her forge a better 
body.</p>

<p>And if you do all that and she STILL leaves, thank her for teaching 
you a lesson - because you just found out that the particular 
environment and habits you built, and the particular woman whose body 
you chose to inhabit them with you, were NOT the ones that will give you
 what you want. That's a valuable lesson, so pay the fuck attention when
 it happens.</p>

<p>And then build a NEW environment, and forge NEW habits, and sculpt 
yourself a NEW body - and find NEW womens' bodies and habits to inhabit 
that new environment with you, and see what happens.</p>

<p>... I mean fuck, how do you think the guys who know what they're talking about around here figured it out in the first place?</p>

<ul>
<li>Buy a Formlabs Form2 printer and a dremel.</li>
<li>Learn to do 3D design in Blender</li>
<li>Design the jewelry in Blender</li>
<li>Buy wax casting resin from Formlabs</li>
<li>Buy silver or gold pellets online</li>
<li>Make some casting sand and a coffee-can crucible</li>
<li>Print your form in the 3D printer using the wax casting resin</li>
<li>Pack it with casting sand and stick it in a coffee can</li>
<li>Pack the rest of the can with sand</li>
<li>Light up the crucible and drop in the metal</li>
<li>Pour the metal onto the sprue tap on top of the sand</li>
<li>Let it cool</li>
<li>Pop it out, cut the sprue, then sand and polish the metal with the dremel.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's about a $4K setup, but it's well worth it for the kind of weird precision work I'm experimenting with. </p>

<p>(Also super fun for making bondage gear with, which is about half of what I meant by "jewelry" anyways.)</p>

 So everyone knows I can cook like a motherfucker. My steaks are to die 
for. My turkey dinners bring crowds. Fuck, my chicken mushroom casserole
 is something people come to me and beg me to make for them. </p>

<p>I'm not cut, but I'm well on the skinny side of 'skinny-fat'. For 42,
 I look like I'm 30 and I've got more muscle definition than most of the
 20-something tech nerds.</p>

<p>I make $150K a year at a bullshit Bay Area startup, writing internal QA tools.</p>

<p>I built my own bookshelves in a weekend. 20 foot wall of solid 
pinewood, stained and detailed, and a hidden "pull the candelabra and 
the last shelf slides aside to reveal a secret passageway to my bedroom"
 mechanism above it, with recessed track lighting on the top to light up
 the whole room.</p>

<p>I make gold and silver jewelry in a forge in my spare time.</p>

<p>I'm the guy people call when they need their car fixed, when they 
need their furniture repaired, when they need their computer unfucked 
from whatever ridiculous shit they downloaded. I'm the guy.</p>

<p>I <em>still</em> can't pull a 7, let alone a 9.</p>

<p>And the reason is simple, and it has NOTHING to do with needs. Most 
of the 20-something shits around me are rolling in pussy, for two simple
 reasons:</p>

<p>Arrogance, and lack of giving a shit about the future.</p>

<p>I mean, sure, they care about <em>their</em> future. But not a one of
 them is willing to stand up and fix the mess our society is turning 
into. Every last one of them just wants to party and get laid while Rome
 burns. </p>

<p>And it <em>works</em>, because being the kind of person who still cares about building and guarding Civilization, isn't sexy.</p>

<p>So yeah, tell me another.</p>

<p>(EDIT: LOL, I said I made jewelry in a forge. Derp.)</p>

<p>Chad can cry to your wife/gf for comfort. You know he can, you've 
probably seen him do it back before your gf got with you. Or you've seen
 him do it with other girls, or heard other girls talk about how sweet 
it was.</p>

<p>YOU can't cry to your wife/gf, because YOU aren't Chad. Crying to your wife/gf without being Chad, is beta.</p>

<p>It's called "countersignalling", and it works like this:</p>

<p>Poor people have to wear poor people clothes, because they can't 
afford better clothes. They look trashy doing it because you can tell 
they're poor.</p>

<p>Middle class people who wear poor people clothes look trashy, because
 people can't tell if they're middle class pretending to be poor, or 
actually poor. In order to look classy, they have to wear rich people 
clothes, and hope that people mistake them for rich.</p>

<p>This means that rich people might be mistaken for middle class, which
 is bad. But rich people can wear poor people clothes and look trendy, 
because everyone knows they're not poor, so wearing poor people clothes 
shows that they can flout fashion and get away with it (unlike a middle 
class person). The fact that they're wearing poor people clothes and 
getting away with it differentiates them from the poor AND the middle 
class.</p>

<p>With emotions, this works the same way. Chad can cry to your wife and
 this makes him look even manlier, and makes her want to fuck him even 
more, because there's no way she could mistake him for you. But you cry 
to your wife, and you're losing half your stuff and your kids, and she's

(functional purpose on the battlegrid).</p>

<p>Wound up with something like this:</p>

<p>Theme: Fighter</p>

<ul>
<li>Fighter Tank: Knight - heavy armor, lots of close-range control (aggro etc.)</li>
<li>Fighter DPS: Warrior - heavy weapons means heavy damage, mastery of every conceivable weapon</li>
<li>Fighter Control: Scout/Ranger - archery, mobility, tracking, predicting your enemy's actions, and Legolas-level bullshit</li>
<li>Fighter Buff: Marshal - Lead-from-the-front, lots of inspiration and tactical coordination effects</li>
</ul>

<p>Theme: Rogue</p>

<ul>
<li>Rogue Tank: Acrobat - kite and dodge, baby</li>
<li>Rogue DPS: Assassin - backstab from the shadows</li>
<li>Rogue Control: Thief - clever ruses, pebbles thrown into bushes, traps and counter-traps</li>
<li>Rogue Buff: Bard - Inspiration, leadership, chicanery and bullshit, all with a pinch of magic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Theme: Mage</p>

<ul>
<li>Mage Tank: Abjurer - shields, wards, deflection spells, and curses against those who attack my allies</li>
<li>Mage DPS: Evoker - I CASTS THE SPELLS THAT MAKES THE PEOPLE FALL DOWN!</li>
<li>Mage Control: Conjurer - Summoning allies, crafting illusions, muddling the mind, and generally being a bit of a dick.</li>
<li>Mage Buff: Artificer - Alchemical potions, magical buffs to armor and weapons, and wacky inventions that just... might... work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Theme: Priest</p>

<ul>
<li>Priest Tank: Paladin - Don't worry yon maiden, I'LL SAVE YOU!</li>
<li>Priest DPS: Inquisitor - Wooden stakes, silver bullets, holy water, and a prayer book. The power of Pelor COMPELS you!</li>
<li>Priest Control: Theurge - locusts, plague, darkness, cats and dogs living together, real wrath-of-God shit.</li>
<li>Priest Buff: Cleric - healing, blessing, holy warding... The Blessings of the Goddess be upon you, brother.</li>

<p>40 Heatcap for a lolcust, with a shutdown at 20? with 75 kph top speed after three LPLs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A locust should never, ever have three LPLs to begin with. The game 
meta has been severely warped by the terribly incomplete heat system 
coded in since 2013.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now you would penalize builds that dont actually need heatsinks, like
 AC builds, for building up heat. This incentivizes them to build in 
more heatsinks, at which point they would just convert to lasers. You 
slashed meta diversity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...no? You're just making things up. AC2, 5, 10 are all very low heat
 compared to even a Medium Laser. But that's arguing at the wrong level 
of detail. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shooting at an enemy now has enormous repercussions, as at any 
moment, you could get attacked by somebody who held off of shooting and 
can now severly outpace and outmaneuver you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is intentional. It's a much more strategic system than the 
current 'ghost heat' solution (which is terrible and needs to die.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And finally, penalizing clan XL for losing a side more than 
currently, on top of the movement penalty incurred by losing the 
engineslots and the lower heatcap further lowering the effective 
movement in your system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Engine slot movement penalty is dumb and shouldn't happen. It should be a heat cap penalty instead (like in the TT game).</p>

<p>You need to look a part, and then act that part, and then have the 
resources to back that act up. You need to find someone famous who you 
could emulate, and then own that narrative by incorporating parts of 
yourself into it.</p>

<p>In fact, here's my general dice pool system:</p>

<p>Attributes 
(Strength,Dexterity,Constitution,Presence,Savvy,Composure,Logic,Intuition,Will)
 are your dice pool. If you have a Strength of 6, you will always roll 6
 dice for Strength-based skill rolls.</p>

<p>Skill level (Untrained, Novice, Professional, Advanced, Expert) 
always determine your target number with each die. Untrained = 6, Novice
 = 5-6, Professional = 4-6, Advanced = 3-6, Expert = 2-6. A '6' always 
explodes (adds another D6 to the roll, at the same TN).</p>

<p>Difficulty determines the threshold - i.e., how many dice must reach 
or exceed the threshold in order to succeed at the task. So an easy task
 might have a threshold of 1; a moderate task a threshold of 3; a 
difficult task a threshold of 5. As long as you roll at least 1 net 
success, you achieve some kind of progress; threshold just determines 
how hard it is to get what you're actually trying to accomplish.</p>

My game, MechBrawl, has an extensive combat system built into it - that's actually the whole point of the game.</p>

<p>Basic gist: there are cards that represent units, there are cards 
that represent upgrades to units (weapons they can mount, etc.) and 
there are cards that represent maneuvers that units can perform.</p>

<p>A unit's stats determine how many maneuvers it can perform and how 
many upgrades it can hold; once a unit or upgrade is played it stays 'on
 the field' until it is destroyed, while maneuvers go back into your 
hand at the end of each 'round' of combat (where a 'round' means "all 
units have played as many maneuvers as they are allowed to").</p>

<p>There are no dice; maneuver cards come with modifiers to units' base stats, and the unit with the better numbers wins.</p>

 make a mix - my King Crab has four LRM5's and 5 tons of ammo, but it 
also has four medium pulse lasers and two LB10X's. The LRMs are 
basically there so that when I wind up having to waddle my fat butt 
halfway across the map to get into the brawl, I can still contribute.</p>

<p>I try to avoid just sitting behind a hill and lurming - I'm always 
trying to actively engage, but if I'm stuck because I'm a slow assault 
and the rest of the team ditched me, I can at least help them out from 
halfway across the map.</p>

<p>Also, in many cases, even if the LRMs aren't hitting, I'm still 
contributing by firing them. The key is to understand your opponent's 
psychology and watch the battlemap - if an enemy mech is engaged with 3 
of my teammates, firing LRMs at him (even at super-long range) gives him
 yet another thing to worry about. Or, if an enemy mech is sniping at my
 teammates or spotting for his own team's LRM fire, LRMs will make him 
ditch his firing position and find cover - which keeps him from 
harrassing my side. </p>

<p>This is a lot less useful when you're wasting 20 missiles per 
trigger-pull, but with LRM5s you can definitely shape your opponents' 
behavior with a few judicious volleys.</p>

financially unstable, untrustworthy, and self-serving. Most likely, they
 got this way from harsh necessity, because their own families were 
financially unstable, untrustworthy, and self-serving. </p>

<p>You're going to find yourself at a serious disadvantage trying to 
maintain your finances, compared to people with stable and supportive 
families. People will not understand this, and will expect you to carry 
your weight anyways. In order to do so, you will have to start making 
tough choices about how to maintain an appearance of success (which is 
necessary in our status-driven culture) while not being drained by 
people around you.</p>

<p>If you are not very careful, this will end up with you having to 
compromise your integrity for the sake of your family's survival, and 
more than likely STILL won't be enough - at which point, the stresses 
will break your family apart. By this time, of course, you'll have sold 
away your integrity without ever noticing it, and won't even notice that
 you're lying, grubbing, and shirking your responsibilities.</p>

<p>And I don't say this because you're a bad person; I say this because statistically, the good ones either turn bad or buckle.</p>

<p>Your mom, your fiance's mother, and your fiance's ex wife might have 
even seemed like good people once, before the cycle got to them. But 
unless they were aware of how hard it ws, and what their options were, 
and what the likely outcomes were, they never even had a chance to 
escape.</p>

<p>I hope you find a chance to escape.</p>

<p>The thing is, there's this psychological concept called the "halo

more access to resources - if they perceive you as having desirable / 
enviable traits. And if they perceive you as having ONE desirable or 
enviable trait, they will assume you have a LOT of them.</p>

<p>And for most men, being able to bang hot girls is a highly enviable trait.</p>

 when an ugly guy asks a pretty girl out, it threatens her standing. 
She's gotta be mean to him / call him a 'creeper' to protect herself.)</p>

<p>Fulltext: When a guy lower on the social totem pole asks a girl 
higher on the social totem pole out, that girl's reputation is on the 
line - if she's seen to not punish guys who are 'beneath her' who make 
the mistake of asking her out, then other people might think that the 
other guy isn't beneath her - which means her own status and reputation 
suffers. Now, if she's SO high above him that it's obvious, then she can
 afford to be magnanimous and kind - letting him down gently. But if 
there's any chance at all that people could ask "wait, is she actually 
one of the losers?", then she pretty much has to crush him to prevent 
her own social clique from descending on her like a pack of vultures.</p>

<p>It's the way of the world.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Drop expenses to below $1.5k/month. If you're serious you can do 
this within 2-3 months without much planning. You're young, you don't 
need fancy shit yet. Trust me.</p></li>
<li><p>Save, save, save. Commit to working this job for the next 4 
years. It's EXACTLY like lifting. It seems boring, tedious, repetitive, 
but you're training mental resilience and you're massively increasing 
your SMV. The best part is, you can look at your bank account and see 
exactly how well you're doing. Treat your bank account like it's the 
high score of a fucking video game.</p></li>
<li><p>In 4 years, you'll have saved $400,000. Walk into your boss's 
office, smile, shake his hand, and resign. Don't ask for a raise; 
they'll fucking offer you one. Walk out the door unless their first 
offer doubles your salary. REMEMBER THIS MOMENT, and use it to fuel your
 frame for the rest of your life.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the $400,000 and sit on it for about a month while you 
brainstorm your own business. Split the $400,000 into three accounts. 
Call them "Runway" ($100k), "Capital" ($200k), and "Parachute" ($100k).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Your Runway is the money you'll be living in while you get your 
business off the ground. Since you're used to living on about $20K a 
year, you can easily afford $30K a year of starting business expenses 
and keep at it for two whole years while you pour your blood, sweat and 
tears into making it work.</p>

<p>The "Parachute" is what you use in case it all goes to shit. You keep
 your parachute ready so that failure no longer enters your mind while 
you start your business. You can go balls-to-the-wall with the Runway 
and Capital.</p>

<p>Your Capital is for investment opportunities that come along while 
you're getting your thing off the ground. Your Parachute is to survive 
on when things go to shit; your Capital is for planting seeds along the 
way so that, by the time this one succeeds or fails, you've grown a new 
$200K of runway and parachute to do it all over again.</p>

<p>WARNING WARNING WARNING: Do not spend any money on women during this 
time (this includes money spent on peacocking - things like fancy cars /
 etc.). There will be MORE hot 16-24 year old women for you when you're 
thirty-five and own your own successful business, than there are now 
when you're a well-paid chump.  Money spent on fancy business suits to 
impress clients is totally worth it, but money spent on looking good to 
women is a waste of precious resources that you can grow exponentially 
later if you save them now.</p>

<p>tldr: Spend the next 4 years grinding, then play the fucking game like a champ. </p>

<ul>
<li>Break Away lets you Retreat one step, and reduces your opponent's accuracy by 1 if you use it during a Strike.</li>
<li>Close In lets you Advance one step, and reduces your opponent's accuracy by 1 if you use it during a Strike. </li>
<li>Counterattack lets you attack simultaneously, which doesn't defend you at all, but at least lets you hurt them back.</li>
<li>Defensive Roll halves all the damage you take</li>
<li>Dodge reduces the accuracy of all their weapons by between -1 and -4 (based on your Reaction skill).</li>
<li>Seize the Initiative <em>completely</em> undoes the attack and gives
 you the next action, but also untaps all their weapons and puts their 
Strike card on the bottom of their deck, so that they effectively 
haven't used up the action slot - which means they can't perform that <em>specific</em> attack again, but you use up an action and they effectively don't.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's also one Move card called Take Cover that sets up 
near-invulnerability for the turn, but it doesn't have any effect at 
Contact range, and it can be thwarted by two different Response cards 
(Seize the Initiative and Intercept).</p>

Here's the breakdown so far:</p>

<p>Your character, equipment, and class are all represented by poker 
cards. You have one two-sided card that represents your character's base
 stats; you then have one card for each piece of equipment your 
character is wearing (characters can wear up to one Helm item, one Armor
 item, one Boots item, one Accessory item, and up to two Hands worth of 
Weapons and/or Shield). Then you have a Class deck, which contains your 
basic Class card and your initial Class Feat, and also contains a set of
 16 purchasable Class Feats which you earn via XP. Each Class Feat costs
 between 1 and 4 XP; a typical adventure will earn you 1-3 XP.</p>

<p>Characters are defined by 8 stats on their character card, plus 1 from armor:</p>

<p>Combat Stats:</p>

<ul>
<li>Health - your health is the number of hearts of damage you can take before you are killed.</li>
<li>Stamina - your stamina is the amount of fatigue / mana you can expend before you must rest.</li>
<li>Speed - your speed is the number of squares you can move per move action; you can spend one fatigue to double this.</li>
<li>Defense - your defense is how hard it is for monsters to hit you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Skills:</p>

<ul>
<li>Might - your might determines your ability to break down doors, lift
 heavy objects, and perform other feats of strength and agility.</li>
<li>Will - your will determines your ability to resist mental and 
magical effects, manipulate or bolster the mood of others, or intimidate
 the weak.</li>
<li>Perception - your perception determines your ability to notice hidden objects and traps.</li>
<li>Knowledge - your knowledge determines your ability to solve puzzles and rememeber lore.</li>
</ul>

<p>Equipment:</p>

<ul>
<li>Armor - Armor comes from equipment rather than being an innate 
character trait; each point of Armor allows you to ignore one heart of 
damage from an attack, unless that attack has Pierce or Bash. If your 
armor reduces an attack to 0 damage, it has no effect on you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Monsters, Treasure, and Monster Tactics are also represented by cards
 - Monster Tactics are a deck of cards that reveal what the monsters are
 doing each turn (so you don't need a GM! the game is 100% co-op). A 
'scenario' will instruct the players how to build each room of the 
dungeon, and then the players run through that room and turn the page to
 reveal the next room once the scenario tells them they can. It will 
also say how many of each type of treasure (Orichalcum, Mithril or 
Adamantine) to place on the map, and how many of each type of monster 
(Construct, Draconic, Infernal, Mercenary, Natural, or Undead). Each 
type of monster has its own Tactic deck that describes how all monsters 
of that type behave each turn. </p>

<p>I think you could simplify a lot if Aim was a weapon itself and not some kind of Pit Fight</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that breaks one of the core mechanics of the game - instead of 
an "attack phase" like in Magic, each Strike (red) card creates an 
attack, and then provides a bonus to that attack. There's currently ten 
Strike cards:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aim - lets you pick which section to deal damage to</li>
<li>Area Saturation - your missiles do less damage, but deal damage even if they miss</li>
<li>Barrage - gain a spread of damage bonuses if you attack with several (usually small) weapons</li>
<li>Charge - lets you move closer when you declare the attack</li>
<li>Critical Hit - destroys one of your enemy's weapons if it hits (they pick which)</li>
<li>Disrupt - lets you cancel one of your enemy's stay-in-play Maneuver effects (you pick which)</li>
<li>Knockdown - your opponent can play one fewer maneuvers this turn</li>
<li>Point-Blank Shot - you can all your weapons at Contact Range, even if they normally can't hit at Contact Range</li>
<li>Smash - trade Accuracy for Damage with one Physical weapon</li>
<li>Suppressing Fire - trade Damage for reducing Reaction with your Ballistic weapons</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't have any of those cards in your hand, you can play any 
of your Maneuvers face-down as a "basic Strike" and get to shoot, but 
you won't get any of those listed bonuses.</p>

<p>Likewise, Movement cards each let you move, but also give you a bonus
 that occurs when you do so (or, like an MtG Enchantment, give you a 
bonus that stays in play after you've done so). If you don't have a good
 Movement card in your hand, you can always play any Maneuver face-down 
as a "basic Move" and get to move, but you don't get any spiffy bonus.</p>

<p>So the basic conceit of the game's Maneuver system is, "there's two 
basic actions you can take: moving and shooting. You can always perform a
 basic version of these actions with any card, OR you can play a 
specific card for its listed purpose and get its bonus effect applied to
 that action." </p>

<p>Merging the weapons with the strike cards (and presumably merging 
some of the non-weapon utility equipment with the movement cards) would 
break the game in a <em>lot</em> of ways, because Maneuvers are how the 
game randomizes outcome. Once you have a weapon, it's on your 'mech and 
visible until it gets blown off. Weapons are (in MtG terms) 
'permanents', while Maneuvers are 'spells', and they interact to produce
 an action.</p>

 to sum up the past 3 posts: you can fit your entire combat mechanics on
 about 2 pages if you use cards; just use "Equipment" card which has 
specific rules for the equipment printed on it, and "Action" / 
"Reaction" cards which have specific rules for how that Action / 
Reaction plays out, and let the interactions between the cards determine
 the flow. Choose suitably evocative names for your Actions, and it 
actually reads pretty well.</p>

 two Maneuvers (although their Marksman gets an additional two Strikes 
after its two standard Maneuvers) - but what just happened, narratively?</p>

<p>Well, I Charged at my opponent, swinging my Axe and spewing a hail of
 bullets from my Rotary Cannon, bursting forward using my Tiger's 
leaping legs, and fired my Jet Pack to close a staggering six hundred 
meters in under a second. My opponent quickly Broke Away in reaction, 
narrowly avoiding the swing of my Axe, but still took a full burst of 
Rotary Cannon fire to the face and legs.</p>

<p>Now it's his turn. He plays an <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Maneuver%20Card%20%28M%29%20-%20Overcharge.png">Overcharge</a>,
 backing up a step as he does so. (Overcharge is a Movement Maneuver, so
 it automatically includes the ability to Advance or Retreat - just like
 Charge, a Strike Maneuver, automatically included the ability to Use 
weapons to deal damage). Overcharge says that each of his Energy Weapons
 deals half its damage (round down) to him; since each of his three 
Particle Cannons has a damage of 3, they'll each deal 1 damage to the 
section of his <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Chassis%20Card%20%288%29%20-%20Marksman.png">Marksman</a> that they're mounted in. Luckily, he has a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Weapon%20Card%20%283%29%20-%20Thermal%20Alloy.png">Thermal Alloy</a> mounted, which halves all Energy damage. Since half of 1 (round down) is zero, he takes no damage from the Overcharge. </p>

<p>I have no appropriate Responses to a Movement Maneuver, so his Action
 is over. Narratively, my opponent began stepping backwards slowly, as a
 bright Yamato Cannon-style glow of charged particles begins emanating 
from the barrel of each of his Particle Cannon - and immense billows of 
steam begin spewing from the seams in his Thermal Alloy, releasing heat 
that would otherwise have melted some of his armor. </p>

<p>If he hits me at Short range with all three of those Particle Cannon,
 I'll be taking 30 damage to the face - even more if he uses those 
Capacitor Arrays. That will vaporize my Mech in one hit, so I need to do
 something before he can pull that off.  I look at my hand, and see a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Maneuver%20Card%20%28M%29%20-%20Take%20Cover.png">Take Cover</a>, a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Maneuver%20Card%20%28R%29%20-%20Counterattack.png">Counterattack</a>, and a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Maneuver%20Card%20%28S%29%20-%20Critical%20Hit.png">Critical Hit</a>. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Maneuver%20Card%20%28M%29%20-%20Take%20Cover.png">Take Cover</a> seems like an excellent idea, so I play that, closing back into Contact range as I do so.

 to replace it. My opponent obviously wants to respond, but they've 
already played two Maneuvers, so it looks like I've lucked out. 
Narratively, I just dove behind some handy terrain while closing the 
distance to him.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Pilot%20Card%20%281%29%20-%20Brash%20Teenager.png">Brash Teenager</a> has a Reaction skill of 3, while my opponent's <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Pilot%20Card%20%282%29%20-%20Elite%20Sniper.png">Elite Sniper</a> has a Reaction skill of 1. Since mine's higher, I get to go first. Since my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Chassis%20Card%20%287%29%20-%20Tiger.png">Tiger</a> gives me a free move on my first action, I decide to go all-in and play the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Maneuver%20Card%20%28S%29%20-%20Charge.png">Charge</a>. Before either of us do anything else, I draw another Maneuver card to replace the Charge that I'm playing. I draw a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Maneuver%20Card%20%28S%29%20-%20Critical%20Hit.png">Critical Hit</a>.</p>

<p>Charge is a Strike, so the first thing I do is declare which weapons 
I'm Striking with. I choose my Rotary Cannon and my Axe, and turn them 
sideways to show that I'm Using them. Then, I read the card I'm playing:
 Charge says "Advance one step as you perform this Strike". So, I move 
one step closer, into Short range. Additionally, my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Chassis%20Card%20%287%29%20-%20Tiger.png">Tiger</a>
 says "When you perform your first Maneuver after Readying, you may 
Advance or Retreat one additional step."  Since I want to get even 
closer so I can hit with my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Weapon%20Card%20%281%29%20-%20Axe.png">Axe</a>,
 I'm going to Advance another step. Now I'm only one step away from my 
opponent - not quite close enough. So, I declare that I'm Using my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Weapon%20Card%20%284%29%20-%20Jet%20Pack.png">Jet Pack</a>'s special ability to Advance an additional step, bringing me directly into Contact range with my opponent's <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Chassis%20Card%20%288%29%20-%20Marksman.png">Marksman</a>. </p>

<p>My opponent checks his hand, and plays a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Maneuver%20Card%20%28R%29%20-%20Break%20Away.png">Break Away</a>
 to Retreat one step, back out of Contact range and into Short range. 
Since I have no Response that can Respond to a Break Away, this finishes
 the Action.</p>

<p>We're at Short Range (but only one frustrating space away from Contact), so my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Weapon%20Card%20%281%29%20-%20Axe.png">Axe</a> is automatically going to miss. My <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Weapon%20Card%20%283%29%20-%20Rotary%20Cannon.png">Rotary Cannon</a>, on the other hand, can hit at Contact AND Short range. It's a Ballistic weapon, and my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Pilot%20Card%20%281%29%20-%20Brash%20Teenager.png">Brash Teenager</a> has a Ballistic Skill of 1, and neither of us have played anything that would modify my weapons' Accuracy - so the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Weapon%20Card%20%283%29%20-%20Rotary%20Cannon.png">Rotary Cannon</a> is going to hit, dealing 3 damage to my opponent. He chooses to assign 2 damage to his <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Chassis%20Card%20%288%29%20-%20Marksman.png">Marksman</a>'s Torso, and 1 damage to its Legs. Now that the Strike is over, I note that my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6sutklmqzl8rkfm/9qyDmk4gc0?lst#lh:null-Weapon%20Card%20%283%29%20-%20Rotary%20Cannon.png">Rotary Cannon</a> says "Ready this weapon after each Strike" - so I turn it back vertically to show that it's Ready to be Used again.</p>

<p>In MechBrawl, there are no dice. Everything is handled by cards. There are four kinds of cards in MechBrawl:</p>

<p>Your Pilot card determines your basic skills. In MechBrawl, there are
 four weapons skills: Energy Weapons, Ballistic Weapons, Missile Weapons
 and Physical Weapons - and two non-weapon skills: Reaction and Tactics.</p>

<p>Your Pilot has a deck of 15 Maneuver cards, of which you can't have 
more than 2 with the same name. Combat is resolved by playing Maneuver 
cards against each other.</p>

<p>Then you have your Chassis card, which is the 'mech itself, and 
various Weapon cards, which represent weapons and equipment mounted on 
the 'mech.</p>

<p>So, here's what a game of MechBrawl looks like:</p>

 fair enough, and I suppose that if "moving on" means anything other 
than Oblivion, then there very clearly IS an afterlife of some kind 
(most people seem to count "reincarnation" as a form of Afterlife).</p>

<p>That said, in keeping with most literary tradition, we never get to see it.</p>

<p>The canonical Harry Potter universe certainly does have an afterlife, which is portrayed quite accurately to canon here. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be fair, I don't consider Limbo to be an "afterlife". King's Cross
 Station, and Hermione's woods here, are an abstraction - a 
representation of a liminal space between life and death. They're a 
metaphor your brain wraps around the process of "moving on".</p>

<p>Harry[Rowlings] got King's Cross Station because that was the place 
where the greatest journey of his life had begun, where the most 
profound changes had happened to him. In his head, it was the canonical 
representation of "leaving your life behind for something new".</p>

<p>If there's an actual Afterlife in Harry Potter, it has yet to be 
shown or described. Wherever that last train goes, or wherever 
Hermione's path beyond the river leads, it is (for them) the ultimate 
Unknown. Maybe wizards get some awesome heaven. Maybe they get some kind
 of hell. Maybe they wake up in Atlantis and take off their 
simulation-interface. Maybe they reincarnate. We can only speculate.</p>

<p>But here, in the space between, a simple choice can be made: go on, or go back.</p>

<p>No time is passing here. Maybe an abstract <em>representation</em> of
 time-passage is perceived, but it is no more real than the gleaming 
white edifice of King's Cross or the pale, misty woods by the brook. Or 
rather, "your mind makes it real".</p>

<p>Limbo isn't an afterlife; it's an abstract representation of the 
place where that choice is made. Harry[Rowlings] and 
Hermione[Ialdabaoth] have made a choice, somewhere in the timelessness 
where the abstract representation of their choice-making algorithms 
formally exist - beyond any material implementation of those algorithms.
 </p>

<p>But the Harry that existed at the moment between 'Avadra' and 
'Kedavera' was not a Harry that could just 'move on', and neither is my 
implementation of HPMOR*.Hermione.</p>

<p>Of course, merely "not moving on" isn't enough - something has to 
reimplement that algorithm, or it's just so much Platonic wankery. 
Harry[Rowlings] had an ace-in-the-hole, in that he had a "back-up soul" 
grafted to him when he got his scar. Hermione - the abstract, 
mathematical description of Hermione's knowledge and choices and desires
 and perspectives - has Harry[Eliezer] working on something with less Ex
 and more Deus and Machina.</p>

<p>Riddle[Rowlings] had six powerful artifacts, each holding a back-up 
soul, plus the one he stuck in Harry. Once he blew those, his mere 
refusal to 'move on' wasn't enough - he's timelessly stuck with the 
desire to be reimplemented and no way to achieve it.</p>

<p>I don't know if I can express this properly, but I do understand. Completely.</p>

<p>I had a friend. His name happened to be Chris Durango, but we all knew him as Harlequin.</p>

<p>He died of cancer when he was 23 and I was 19. He died in the most 
fitting way I could imagine - screaming and cursing and crying that it 
was entirely unfair, and that he should have had a long life spreading 
cynicism and wry observations among his friends.</p>

<p>We had a long, ongoing, utterly delightful philosophical conversation
 that lasted four years, that I will never be able to finish with him.</p>

<p>He will never see that I managed to claw my way out of my depression,
 or that I fell back into it later, or any of the ways in which I've 
come to respect his viewpoints about... well, most of everything. </p>

<p>He would have had so many wonderfully acerbic things to say about 
cellphones, and ubiquitous computing, and gender roles, and how weird 
the 21st century has got. I can't even imagine half of what he would 
have said, but it would have been brilliant, and I will never know. Just
 as importantly, <em>HE</em> will never know, because he isn't here anymore.</p>

<p>So, with absolutely no punches pulled, FUCK death.</p>

<p>That said... I'm not quite you. Reality judged me and found me 
wanting; maybe because I was forced to endure a fundamentalist Christian
 elementary schools and public high schools and a backwards hick town 
with no stimulation until my mom died at 23 and I managed to escape; 
maybe because I wasn't born with the same degree of neurochemical 
regulation that your brain was graced with; but sometimes I choose to 
escape, because in the real world I am powerless and terrified and 
alone, and there is NOTHING I can do about it except fantasize about 
something better.</p>

<p>Become good at something.</p>

<p>I'm damn good at computer programming. I'm damn good at business 
analysis and process improvement. I'm damn good at makeshift 
engineering. I know CPR / basic triage, and can actually keep my head in
 an emergency well enough to use it. I am the sort of man who runs <em>towards</em>
 the fire. I can write very, very well. I can draw pretty well, and am 
actively working on improving my art skills. I can sculpt. I can carve 
woodwork. I can work leather. I can cast metal. I'm learning (slowly) to
 be a blacksmith. If it came down to it, I could probably code a CNC to 
stamp an AK-47 out of bare metal and piping and assemble it. I 
understand more chemistry, biology, physics, and psychology than most 
people who have a PhD in it, I just never got the credentials because 
they're a bunch of shit and I've never seen anything from the people who
 <em>did</em> get the credentials to tell me that they or their credentials are worth my respect.</p>

<p>I am good at a fucking TON of things, but that never translates to being <em>confident</em>
 that I'm good at things. I am constantly out-competed by people whose 
skill is of inferior quality, but who are willing to hide their flaws 
and play up their strengths, and cover it all in a layer of narcissistic
 bullshit.</p>

<p>I am fucking ALLERGIC to bullshit, even though it's quite obviously what makes the world go 'round.</p>

<p>I can confidently say that if there was a zombie apocalypse tomorrow,
 and I could get more than 20 people to fucking shut up and listen to 
me, I could reforge civilization for them with my own two fucking hands.</p>

<p>But I can't get more than 20 people to fucking shut up and listen to 
me, because no one gives a shit about competence. They care about 
confidence, and appearance, and bullshit.</p>

<p>And I'm telling you, I don't know how to stop being allergic to 
bullshit. I'm totally willing to learn how to sling bullshit if that's 
what it takes, but first I have to stop being allergic to it. And I need
 a game plan for that, or I'm just going to keep self-sabotaging.</p>

 necessarily; some of us have sufficient mental impairment that even our
 own decisions aren't "completely up to us". And ultimately, if one 
wants to really swallow the bitter truth, men will always be in a Pareto
 (80/20) curve - only the top performers will have any <em>actual</em> 
value. If you can't reach that level, and you've sustained enough damage
 that your own mental processes are no longer reliable enough to trust 
self-mastery, and you don't have enough willpower to push through, how 
do you push through anyways?</p>

<p>Sex doesn't really interest me, especially not "notches on my 
bedpost"; what I'm after is respect and prestige, and I don't see either
 of those as attainable, even if I pick up some of your techniques. Has 
anyone worked on these problems?</p>

<p>EDIT:
Actually, let me reframe that.</p>

<p>If it was "completely up to me", I wouldn't need a red pill, would I?</p>

<p>For me, "maintaining frame" is my primary deficit that causes me to 
fail everywhere else. I can't keep pushing through with my exercise 
routine because I self-sabotage. I can't keep up my self-improvement 
because I ultimately can't convince myself that I <em>deserve</em> to improve.</p>

<p>The thing that attracted me to TRP in the first place was that you guys are the only place offering actual, <em>TACTICAL</em> advice about any of this shit.</p>

<p>So, what is the tactical advice for building a frame from scratch? 
I've been told all my life that I'm a victim, and I'm tired of it, but I
 have no other mindset to fall back on. I can't even describe the lay of
 the obstacle course without telling myself that I'm just "making 
excuses" and "if I wanted to change I would have already". Fuck, I can't
 go five seconds without telling myself what a piece of shit, worthless 
loser I am, and how I'm a loser PRECISELY BECAUSE I can't stop telling 
myself what a loser I am, and how I'm a loser because I can't stop 
telling myself that I'm a loser because I can't stop telling myself... 
and it's ridiculous, but that doesn't make it <em>stop</em>. So what makes it stop?</p>

<p>I need actual, tactical advice that doesn't sound like this: </p>

 I was 23, I moved from Bakersfield, CA to Tempe, AZ. I packed 
everything that would fit in my little Honda Del Sol and headed east on 
Highway 58.</p>

<p>Somewhere in Nevada I got lost, and wound up driving up a narrow 
canyon road at 1 in the morning. In the rain. When I say "narrow", you 
have to understand that this was the sort of road you'd expect to see 
mules traversing, not cars. Forty foot sheer cliff going up on my right.
 Seventy foot sheer cliff going down on my left. It was paved, sure, but
 there was no guardrail, and the dotted yellow line through the middle 
seemed like someone's idea of a joke.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I see a car's headlights illuminating the road ahead of me; motherfucker is doing 75 and on <em>my</em>
 side of the road. He notices me just in time and swerves to the 
outside, so I swerve to the inside and he whoooshes on past. And then my
 headlight clips the rock face.</p>

<p>Next thing I know, my car is doing a 720 spin, and that blind turn - 
with no guardrail and a 70 foot dropoff - is looming up ahead (and then 
to my left, and then behind, and then to my right, and then ahead 
again...), getting closer and closer. I wind up pointing forward again 
just as I reach the edge, brakes squealing... and then <em>ch-thunk</em> my front wheels are off the edge of the cliff. </p>

<p>I come to a rest, Wile E. Coyote style, with my car see-sawing on the
 edge of this canyon, the headlights flooding into the little wash 
below. I shit you not, there are coyotes on the bottom of that canyon, 
and they are staring up at me. In my memory, one of them even licks his 
lips.</p>

<p>At this point I say "fuck this" and try to back off, but... front 
wheel drive. Where are my front wheels? Off the edge of the cliff. FM 
soon-to-be-over L.</p>

<p>I roll down the back window (Del Sols have a rear window that you can
 roll down), unbuckle my seat belt, and start to shift up out of my seat
 to climb out the back of my car; coyotes can have my fucking laptop and
 clothes. Nope! Car starts leaning forward when I shift position, and 
slides a little further off the edge. </p>

<p>So I settle niiiiice and slow back into my seat, grab my cellphone, 
and dial 911. Barely have enough service (this was back in 1998), but 
eventually I get a connection. </p>

<p>I have to explain which road I think I'm on, and they say they'll send a police car and a tow truck.</p>

<p>I then wait ONE AND A HALF HOURS on the edge of that damn cliff until they show up, while the coyotes wait for dinner.</p>

<p>Ever since that day, I drive like a grandma. I no longer care when I get anywhere, so long as I get there in one piece.</p>

<p>This happens whenever culture progresses - government jobs, 
especially enforcement jobs, will always attract the more conservative 
members of society, and bureaucracies will always crystalize the views 
of the people who created them. Thus, people who care most about 'law 
and order' will be exposed to a subculture where 'law and order' trumps 
fairness and common human decency, and where the proper reaction to the 
larger culture's abandonment of their values is a siege mentality.</p>

<p>Even the concept of "decency" is co-opted - "decency" becomes about 
preventing women from accessing medical care because we disapprove of 
the procedure, or preventing the wrong kind of people from marrying, or 
jailing 15 year olds for admiring their own bodies, or gang-raping women
 with drug detection tools because we're afraid someone somewhere might 
enjoy themselves too much if we let them ingest the wrong substances. </p>

<p>A big part of the problem is fear, of course. As long as you're 
afraid of your kids doing drugs, you're part of a chain of approval that
 lends force to the people who gang-raped this women. As long as you're 
afraid of your car being broken into, you're part of a chain of approval
 that lends force to the people who break into houses and shoot dogs. As
 long as you're afraid of your children being abducted, you're part of a
 chain of approval that lends force to destroying a teenager's life 
because they peed in the bushes outside a party.</p>

<p>It's reasonable to take precautions, but it's not reasonable to let 
people tell you what to be afraid of. Teach yourself statistics, and 
learn to read the actual numbers. When a news reporter says "two hundred
 and fifteen murders occurred in the last year in the greater metro 
area", stop and ask yourself how many humans live in that area. Pull up a
 map, and look at where those murders occurred. Then ask yourself what 
the likelihood is that a murder will happen in <em>your</em> neighborhood, and what you can do to prevent it without involving thugs with badges.</p>

<p>Of course, the deepest fear is fear of your neighbors. The more 
afraid of the outside world you are, the more insular you become, and 
the more queer and strange the neighbors seem. How often do you just 
hang out and talk with them? Do you ever just invite them over for 
dinner? When the weather gets warmer, try having barbeques in the back 
yard and inviting everyone over. </p>

<p>Robust communities are the solution to this sort of siege mentality. 
When a SWAT team breaks down a door in a robust community, it makes the 
news, and the popularity of local SWAT teams goes down a notch. As 
support for the siege mentality is eroded at the local level, the state 
and federal level eventually lose the foundation of normalcy that 
they've built these atrocities on, and bald-face abuses like this become
 harder and harder to get away with.</p>

<p>But it starts with meeting your neighbor.</p>

success at treating PTSD than any other currently-approved therapy. If I

 which is invariably "I am a bad person and just need to have more 
willpower". I think WillingtoNegotiate et.al. are smart enough to

 the problem with that is "accepting that the situation was normal given

<p>Neo is called the "Neocortex" because it's the stuff that humans have
 that animals don't (or at least, don't have as much of). The Amygdala 
is part of the "animal" brain, so good luck teaching it anything too 
complex for your dog to understand.</p>

<p>Basically, what you need to do is teach Neo to make better decisions,
 and teach Amy when to shut up and give Neo a few minutes to think. 
These are separate training tasks, and both are pretty damn intensive.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there <em>are</em> some promising drugs coming 
out, which basically use chemicals to accomplish what you just

<p>To use a metaphor:</p>

<p>Your brain has a bunch of different parts to it - three of those 
parts are called the "neocortex", the "amygdala", and the "cerebellum".</p>

<p>Neo's a smooth operator, and always has a plan if you just give him a few damn minutes to think about it.</p>

<p>Amy's prone to freak-out, and tends to solve everything by either 
hitting it REALLY hard, or running away from it REALLY fast (aka 
fight-or-flight).</p>

<p>The cerebellum is like the driver's seat for the body. The way Amy 
and Neo work is, Amy sits in the driver's seat with her hands on the 
wheel, and Neo sits shotgun with all our maps and mission specs in his 
lap. With me so far?</p>

<p>So, when you're having a freak-out, what's basically happening is Amy
 has gone bugshit and is slamming on the gas, spinning the wheel and 
bugging the fuck out NOW, while Neo's sitting in the passenger seat 
shouting something about minefields and going off-mission and how bad 
the CO's gonna yell at us when we get back to base.</p>

<p>In an ideal brain, Neo's got one more stripe than Amy, and Amy 
respects the chain of command. What you've got in PTSD is a broken chain
 of command, because one time Amy followed Neo's orders and things got 
REALLY crazy, so now when things look like they're about to get crazy 
Amy doesn't trust Neo's orders anymore.</p>

<p>And you can't just put Neo in the driver's seat. Check out this picture:</p>

<p><a href="http://mybrainnotes.com/amygdala-prefrontal-cortex.jpg">http://mybrainnotes.com/amygdala-prefrontal-cortex.jpg</a></p>

<p>The "prefrontal cortex" is Neo, and the "amygdala" is Amy. That weird
 looking tree-thing in the bottom back is the cerebellum. Neo just 
flat-out can't reach the cerebellum without going through Amy.</p>

<p>So, you're going to have to fix your brain's chain of command. You're
 going to have to work out some system to remind Amy to listen to Neo, 
BEFORE Amy decides that Neo's full of shit and she's bugging them out of
 there.</p>

<p>This will take a LOT of time and effort, but remembering that it's a chain of command issue should help.</p>

<p>"The problem of badly behaved women would best be solved by 
coercively subjecting them to the authority of well behaved men. Some 
women would be mistreated as a result, but fewer would be badly 
behaved."</p>

<p>"Female psychology and sexuality is such as to make the concept of 
marital rape meaningless. Females are never happy putting out sexually 
in the context of equality even if they volunteer to do so. Sex outside a
 relationship is bad for a woman whether it is called rape or not, and 
conversely, not only is sex inside a relationship good for a woman, it 
is better if the relationship is one in which she lacks power.</p>

<p>The relevant difference, the important difference, is not female 
empowerment versus female disempowerment, but permanent relationship 
versus random sex. If coercion is applied to cause random sex, it is 
rape, harms women, harms society, and harms good men. If coercion is 
applied to prevent random sex and ensure sex inside a permanent 
relationship, it is not rape, it benefits women, benefits good men, and 
benefits society."</p>

<p>Then what IS logically connected to 'ought'? If 'ought' does not have
 any real effects, then in what sense is 'ought' even meaningful?</p>

<p>in ELI5 terms: In Catch 22, at one point someone defines Catch 22 as 
"We are allowed to do anything that you can't stop us from doing."</p>

<p>Why is this "bad"? The only explanation I've got is "Well, you 
wouldn't like it if someone did that to you", but that seems easily 
refutable by "Sure, but what could I do about it?" and "If I can't do 
anything about it, what does it matter how much I wouldn't like it?"</p>

 Certainly. But the kind of panhandler that can make $40k a year is not 
the typical mentally ill homeless person who desperately needs their

<p>Remember that any time there is a group of people who legitimately 
need our compassion, there will be people showing up to exploit that 
compassion by pretending to be a part of that needy group. And remember 
that the fakers will always have more resources, more opportunities, and
 more visibility than the legitimately needy, so their stories will 
inevitably seem more prominent than those who truly need help - but that
 doesn't change the fact that the vast majority of people who ask for 
help aren't scamming, and do need it.</p>

<p>Each of these is an answer to a particular question. The question, in
 ELi5 terms, is "Why does one thing happen and not another?" </p>

<p>Have you ever imagined that an event might have gone differently? 
Each "interpretation" of quantum mechanics explains a different way that
 the universe "decides" which events happen, and which events don't.</p>

<p>(But keep in mind that "quantum mechanics" deals with very, VERY tiny
 events - big events like the things that you notice in your own life 
are made out of BILLIONS of these tiny events before they become 
noticable).</p>

<p>The Copenhagen statistical interpretation basically says, "the 
universe rolls dice." I.e., events are ultimately totally random and 
unpredictable, other than to say "this event is more likely than this 
one". You CANNOT know which event will happen.</p>

<p>The Penrose interpretation is that "measurement" or "interaction" 
causes collapse. Many people take this a step further, and say 
"conscious observation causes collapse" - i.e., NOTHING ever happens 
unless someone is there to notice it. Some people even go further than 
THAT, and claim that conscious beings decide WHICH event happens, 
through some mysterious mystical process.</p>

<p>The Everett-Wheeler interpretation says "they ALL happen". Somewhen, 
there's a universe where you never got that job, because someone spilled
 a coke on your best tie just before you walked into the interview. 
Somewhen else, you met a beautiful girl at 19 and married her and had 
three kids. Somewhen else, you died from a bee sting at age seven. And 
so on and so on. Everything that could ever have happened, happened, but
 the more "likely" something is to have happened, the more "universes" 
or timelines there are in which that thing happened.</p>

<p>Does all that make sense?</p>

<p>What do you believe separates successful game designers from 
unsuccessful ones? Do you think you've succeeded primarily on the 
strength of your ideas, or are there other skills that helped contribute
 to your success? What would you recommend to an unknown and unproven 
game designer, who has a passion for making games and who wants to see 
their creations played but doesn't have any name recognition or 
financial support yet?</p>

 What would you say about joining forces, saving a lot of design effort,

<p>Also, here's an alternate system:</p>

<p>'Stat' determines your dice pool, exclusively. As "raw talent", your 
stat is pretty much the limit of what you can accomplish. I usually have
 'Stat' range from 1 to 6 without some kind of supernatural or 
technological boost.</p>

<p>'Skill' determines how reliably you can apply that raw talent. At a 
Skill of 0, only a '6' is a success. At Skill 1, a roll of '5' or '6' is
 a success. At Skill 2, a roll of '4', '5', or '6' is a success, and so 
on. Obviously, 'Skill' ranges from 0 to 4.</p>

<p>If you want more granularity in skill, just replace the type of dice 
rolled. White Wolf popularized the D10 pool, which gives you a skill 
granularity of 0 to 9, at the cost of making unskilled players <em>much</em> less likely to succeed.</p>

robots (mecha / mechs) out of parts, and then fight them against each

<p>I think it's innovative in that it gives you all the tactical options
 you'd normally expect from a tabletop war game, without ever requiring 
any assets except for poker-sized cards (and maybe counters to track 
damage).</p>

<p>The first few images in the above link are the instruction booklet; 
everything else is the actual cards. All of them. Front and back, for 
the most part. The art is still in prototype phase; I'm an okay artist, 
but I'm hoping for better.</p>

<p>It isn't, and in fact the people who hire them are MORE contemptible than Wal-Mart, and yes, Wal-Mart is still contemptible.</p>

 The system I've heard is called a "basic wage", and works a lot like 
the old "flat tax" system that the more esoteric Republicans liked to 
kick around in the 90's. Here's the plan:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove ALL OTHER welfare benefits. </li>
<li>Remove ALL OTHER taxes and subsidies.</li>
<li>Give EVERYONE a basic income of $25,000.</li>
<li>Tax ALL income beyond that $25,000 at 50%.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyone who is "middle class" sees a huge effective tax drop. Anyone 
who is poor sees a huge effective increase in welfare pay-out. Anyone 
who makes more than about $150,000 a year and has no family sees an 
effective tax increase. </p>

<p>There's no loopholes, no cheats, and no government meddling, because 
it's all YOUR MONEY. There's no minimum wage, no food stamps, no section
 8 housing. There's just your basic income, which is completely enough 
to live in a crappy apartment, feed yourself, and watch TV all day if 
that's what you <em>really</em> want to do, but the moment you actually 
want anything worth showing off, you're going to have to get off your 
ass and contribute to society.</p>

needed new training and new equipment to deal with the dark menace.</p>

<p>And then they came for the mexican gang-bangers, but because we were scared of the mexican gang-bangers too, we cheered.</p>

<p>And then they came for the casual black drug users, but because we 
couldn't tell the difference between a casual black drug user and a 
black gang-banger, we cheered.</p>

<p>And then they came for the casual mexican drug users, but because we 
figured they were all illegal immigrants anyways, we cheered.</p>

<p>And then they came for the lower-class white drug users, but because 
Fox News said that they were all meth-heads and just as scary as the 
blacks and mexicans, we cheered.</p>

<p>And then they got the address wrong, and shot up a family, but 
because it was in a poor neighborhood and Fox News said they probably 
deserved it anyways, we cheered.</p>

<p>And then they beat the ever-living shit out of some protesters, but 
because Fox News said they were socialist hippy weirdos, we cheered.</p>

<p>And then they beat up some black driver, but because we figured no 
black person should be able to afford a car that good, we cheered.</p>

<p>And then they started coming for us, and we looked around and all the
 people that we thought would stand up for us were cheering.</p>

<p>If you're starving? Fuck yes it's okay to steal food.</p>

<p>Look, I'm going to go all Lockean here: society exists because people
 enter into an agreement with each other, to agree to aid each other and
 protect each other's interests. It's called the "social contract", and 
part of that social contract is that you're happier, healthier, and 
safer in general than if you just winged it on your own in some kind of 
depraved Mad Max anarchist wasteland. </p>

<p>If you are living in a country where food is plentiful, and you are 
starving, your society has basically broken its side of the social 
contract. You are therefore no longer ethically bound to hold up your 
end. If society tells you that you have to die just because you were 
born the wrong color or with the wrong last name, you have every right 
to say "fuck you, I want to live".</p>

<p>The only true 'evil' is powerlessness. We pay lip-service to other 
ethical ideas, but ultimately we treat the powerless with contempt 
because we can, until they stop being powerless. Then we act like they 
never deserved the contempt they were treated with, and act like the

<p>See, this doesn't make much sense to me. In my view, if someone 
doesn't want to help you, and you can't make them help you, that's 
absolutely a reflection on you, since you're the one who isn't helped. 
If you CAN make them help you, then their lack of willingness to help

<p>How well it's presented and how succeptible they are to the idea, 
yes. But "how succeptible they are to the idea" is itself just a matter 
of what other forces are acting on them, many of which are also 
controllable (for example, whether they've had enough to eat, and 
whether they're living in fear of some real or imagined looming 
disaster).</p>

<p>A good deal of the world almost was. Are you suggesting that there

somehow lacking in the hearts of Americans and British? If so, can you 
explain how that happened?</p>

<p>Yes, economic pressures and presentations of status go a long way,

 in automation mean that a lot of the work that is currently being done 
by humans can be instead done by machinery, supervised by a smaller pool
 of humans. For most of human history, a small number of people have 
been supported in relative luxury by a much larger population of 
effective slaves. By replacing this slave labor with technological 
solutions, we make much of our population redundant. </p>

<p>One naive idea that technological utopianists will throw around is 
that we should then turn and elevate that redundant population to the 
same level of luxury as the ruling class - the problem with this idea is
 that you need more than technological force-multipliers; you also need 
raw material resources. And while we definitely have the technology to 
give everyone a life of luxury, we do NOT have the raw material 
resources to do so if "everybody" is several billion people.</p>

<p>Luckily, as fertility rates drop, we slowly approach a population 
that can be stably provided for with our technology, without 
overburdening the environment. At around 1.5 billion people, we should 
reach a level of luxury where no one fundamentally has to perform labor 
unless they want to, and where people can turn entirely to creative, 
innovative or hedonistic pursuits.</p>

Being a non-believer, what is an appropriate and responsible eulogy to 
deliver to a room full of believers?</a>                  </h4>                  <br>                  <div class="container">                  <div class="md"><p>Every one of us, I'm sure, has different ideas about what life and death mean. Different perspectives of the spiritual.</p>

<p>I'd like to talk for a moment about the physical. The real, the tangible, the hear and now.</p>

<p>Every human being that is born is the most precious thing imaginable -
 a new and unique perspective, gazing out into the universe. Just like 
no to fingerprints are alike, no two perspectives are ever quite alike. 
There's a lot of physical reasons for that - the way the brain wires up 
is equal parts genetics and circumstance - but the end result is, there 
will never be another person quite like any of us.</p>

<p>And yet.</p>

<p>The thing that makes that perspective so extraordinarily precious is 
that it can be shared. As someone grows, we come to understand how they 
see the world, and as we love them, maybe we come to see the world a 
little bit in that way, too. We take on pieces of their perspective. You
 might even say, if you were feeling sentimental, that we carry pieces 
of their soul with us, everywhere we go.</p>

<p>Every one of you is the product someone's love. You carry with you 
little pieces of the souls of those that you've loved, little pieces of 
the souls of those that loved you enough to share them with you.</p>

<p>I don't mean 'soul' in any ephemeral, spiritual sense, either. I mean 'soul' in the sense of <em>essence</em>
 - in the sense of whatever it is that makes us recognize a loved one 
for what they are. Little behaviors, little thoughts, little ideas. 
Perspectives. </p>

<p>So in a very real, very physical way, no one ever dies. Because we 
are human beings, everyone that has touched us lives on within us in a 
very real way. And lives on within those that we go on to touch.</p>

<p>Every one of you that has loved the deceased, go out and share that 
love with others. Share it by remembering the things about the deceased 
that made you love them, and expressing those things through your own 
physical body while you still have it. There's a few trillion atoms 
deciding to be 'you' for a little while, so spread the love while you 
have the chance. </p>

<p>The basic gist is, if all we are is atoms, then the brain is nothing 
but a computer designed to run the human mind. And there's no reason you
 can't - at least partially - simulate another mind inside it.</p>

<p>The more you love someone, and the more you get to know them, the 
better your simulation of that person. It's what gives you the "voice in
 your head" that sounds like them, and tells you what they'd think of 
what's happening when they aren't around.</p>

<p>Well, guess what? they ARE around.</p>

<p>The mind is not the body; we change out our atoms every few years.</p>

<p>The mind is not the specific continuity of the body; we change too much in different situations and different circumstances.</p>

<p>The mind is a particular kind of process. </p>

<p>When you love someone, you allow them to become literally bigger than
 they were before - you take in a part of them, running their software 
on your own hardware.</p>

<p>When someone loves you, they do the same for you.</p>

<p>Every lesson you give to the next generation is literally a piece of 
you that will live on in them, running as a tiny emulation of you. It 
will change and evolve over time, but so does the rest of you.</p>

<p>Every lesson you learn is literally a piece of those teachers living 
on in you, running as a tiny emulation of them. It will change and

<p>Those who are loved never truly die. This is literal, this is

<p>If I were being honest with my self-analysis, I'd probably grade myself as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mechanics - A+ (every game I have ever made and shown to people, 
the unanimous response has been "wow, this is really cool and 
innovative! This is a really fun game!")</p></li>
<li><p>Programming - A- (I've done business app development for almost 
20 years, I got into the industry to do games, and I've collaborated on 
one professional title)</p></li>
<li><p>Writing/Content - B+ (people tend to like my ideas, but I tend to not flesh them out as well as people would like)</p></li>
<li><p>Art - C+ (my art style is described as "quirky" and "fun", but it
 doesn't "pop" or seem to grab people's attention the way I want it to)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As for being the 'Idea Guy', if you strip away Mechanics, 
Programming, Writing/Content and Art... what exactly is left to call an 
"idea"?</p>

<p>I do! It's neither a pen-and-paper RPG nor a computer game; it's a 
CCG (with as little emphasis as possible placed on the first 'C', since I
 hate the idea of random boosters with a passion).</p>

<p>Well, I actually have three projects: one card game (99% completion, 
which in my mind means "the game has gone through 2 years of playtesting
 and iterative development, art layout is done, instructions and 
supplemental materials are done, the only thing left is to do print 
layout on the art so it's print-ready and even that's half done"), one 
card-and-board game (45% completion), and one computer game version of 
the card-and-board game (10% completion).</p>

<p>I hope you're still reading this, because this is something that I needed to hear after I lost my faith:</p>

<p>Everything good that you took from Christianity is still in you. You 
can still be a good person - a better person, even - without God. In 
some ways it's going to be harder, because now the only person keeping 
you good is you. But that makes it all the more important to be good. </p>

<p>You are the product of six million years' worth of social apes - 
creatures that knew how to treat each other with kindness, make 
sacrifices for the good of the tribe, and plan for the future so that 
their children could have a better world. </p>

<p>In six million years, this instinct has brought us from scrabbling 
over scraps in the African savannah, to walking on the moon. It has 
brought us from all the tribal violence that you read in the Bible, into
 an era where universal brotherhood seems like it might almost be an 
attainable goal.</p>

<p>Loss of Christianity isn't the realization that there's no Heaven; 
it's the realization that the only Heaven we'll ever see is the one we 
make, together, with our own hands.</p>

<p>I don't see how anyone can ever act against their will, since by 
definition one is applying their will whenever they make a choice. The 
universe is in state S. S contains a series of potential actions X1, X2,
 X3, X(n)... each of which has an anticipated consequence Y1, Y2, Y3, 
Y(n)... My "will" is just whatever neurobiological process causes me to 
choose a specific n.</p>

<p>There's no way for me to "act against my will", because however I 
act, that was my will. It might be that a particular Y(n) contains the 
consequence, "I wish I had had other options" or "I wish I hadn't had to
 choose to do X(n)", but the weather can cause that just as much as 
other people. Right?</p>

<p>It seems to me that a more coherent definition of force is "any 
action which restricts the range of choices of another agent", which is 
sticky because if there's no distinction between action and inaction, 
then I can be guilty of a passive initiation of force - and we're right 
back to obligatory reparations and wealth redistribution and all that.</p>

 this discussion is being... uncharacteristically fruitful, would you 
mind if I try to challenge the part of Objectivism-as-I-understand-it 
that I have the most trouble with? </p>

<p>Ethically, I'm a hardcore consequentialist - part of which means I 
have more-than-deontological problems with distinguishing "action" from 
"inaction" (in fact, I'd say I have <em>ontological</em> problems with 
distinguishing "action" from "inaction") - my comprehension of the 
universe  manifests as a list of "if I perform &lt;X&gt;, &lt;Y&gt; will
 happen with &lt;Z%&gt; probability" hypotheses, and my comprehension of
 myself manifests as a list of "If &lt;Y&gt; happening measures 
&lt;W&gt; utility".</p>

<p>So "do nothing" is just another &lt;X&gt;, with no particular 
ontological significance to privilege it compared to "blow up Congress 
with a ray gun" or "buy the entire contents of a See's Candies and give 
it away one piece at a time to every child I see". </p>

<p>To put it in what I hope is closer to your language: I can't manage 
to understand how "inaction" is anything but just another action, so the
 "initiation" distinction in "initiation of force" makes no ontological 
sense to me.</p>

<p>Can you see how that framework makes comprehending the Objectivist/American-Libertarian definition of "coercion" difficult?</p>

<p>In general, yes. Around here, Objectivism tends to intersect with 
some particularly weird brands of neo-fascism, which always struck me as
 really, <em>really</em> hypocritical until I spent some time trying to 
understand where they were coming from. It mostly seems to be about a 
sort of survival of the fittest enforcement of the "just world" fallacy,
 where force is justified if you can get away with it because weak 
beings aren't actually people, or at the very least aren't worth enough 
economically to treat as people.</p>

<p>Fair enough. But in that case, I have a completely different critique:</p>

<p>By narrowing your critique to Comptean altruism, you're using

<p>This is a problem with language, where the semantics and the 
pragmatics don't always line up. There are pragmatic consequences to 
using "altruism" exclusively to mean "Comptean altruism", not the least 
of which is the fact that it allows certain near-sociopathic douchebags 
to convince themselves that Rand said they can be as greedy as they want
 and not worry about consequences.</p>

Altruist here. I don't believe I'm a fraud.</p>

<p>Here's my rational argument in favor of altruism:</p>

<p>The Prisoner's Dilemma sucks. More generically, there's a lot of 
situations in Game Theory where, if you can't trust your opponent and he
 can't trust you, things work out worse for <em>both</em> of you.</p>

<p>It turns out that in a good number of game-theoretical situations, 
mutually-enforced altruism with a certain tolerance for cheating is 
actually far better than every-man-for-himself, because you can create a
 larger net wealth and create less of a power disparity between 
potential victims and potential predators, which makes "looting" 
behaviors less appealing.</p>

<p>In less theoretical situations, altruism is socially useful to people
 who are ideologically opposed to coercion, because the more 
equal-in-fact people are, the harder it is to get away with coercing 
them. Also, altruism helps create environments where people are more 
likely to become rational and self-directed, and generally help the 
worst-off behave less like animals and more like men. Since empirical 
evidence has shown that more behavioral differences between poor people 
and rich people are due to environment than are due to genetics, it 
stands to reason that improving their environment will lower the risk 
they pose to the rest of us. Plenty of studies have shown that it's 
actually cheaper and more effective to just feed, clothe and house 
people than it is to fund military or police force and attempt to fight 
and contain them in their own ghettos. </p>

<p>Additionally, an environment where some people can get away with 
coercion because they have more power is an environment where people are
 less likely to fight coercion, which turns into a nasty feedback loop. 
Massive power disparities are inherent threats to free markets and free 
people, because they make coalition-building positive feedback loops 
more likely. </p>

<p>Now, so far, all of this can be considered mere 'benevolence' rather 
than actual 'altruism', because I'm explaining ways in which altruism 
benefits me. This is because I'm using "altruism" in the 
game-theoretical / evolutionary-biological sense, which is where much of
 my expertise lies. But, even in the face of self-sacrifice, I still 
believe it is important to be altruistic, and here's why:</p>

<p>I'm not going to live forever.</p>

<p>There are things which are more important to me than the mere 
continuation of my own (hopefully pleasant) sense-experiences. Primary 
among these things is the continued legacy of sapient beings. I want to 
make things better for myself, but I also want to make things better for
 the future. I consider this an aesthetic choice, ultimately, in the 
Nietzschean sense - I choose to call "beautiful" that which maximizes 
the power and intelligence and creativity of future sapient beings, and 
so I inflict an artistic vision on the world that I believe will 
maximize the power and intelligence and creativity of future sapient

<p>Imagine Timmy has a real desk, and he likes to build model planes and
 model ships on it. Timmy also has to do his homework sometimes. </p>

<p>Timmy is neat and meticulous. When he starts on a new model plane 
kit, he lays out all the parts, puts little dividers into the box that 
the kit came in, and sorts all the parts into the dividers. Then, when 
his mom comes in and tells him to stop playing with his models and do 
some homework, he just puts all the bits into the appropriate divider 
sections, closes the box, and carefully sets the model on top of the 
box. When he comes back to the model, the glue has dried and everything 
is where he put it.</p>

<p>Billy also likes to make model airplanes. He's not nearly as neat as 
Timmy, though. When his mom tells him to do his homework, he just throws
 all the parts back into the box, throws the plane into the box, shoves 
the box off his desk and starts doing his homework. He feels like this 
saves him a lot of time, and he's right - Timmy takes almost thirty 
seconds to clean his desk, while Billy only takes about five seconds. 
But later, when Billy comes back to his airplane, he finds that the 
wings bent funny and glued in a weird position, and the landing gear and
 the decal sheet are glued to the cockpit.</p>

<p>Some Windows games are like Timmy - they go through this whole 
process of saving their current rendering state, then gracefully 
deallocating memory so that when you swap back to them, they look fine. 
This takes a bit of effort and a bit of extra coding, so some games are 
like Billy and don't bother - and when you swap in and out, they freak 
out and mangle the display.</p>

<p>Imagine capitalism is like a big video game tournament, where you're 
supposed to find out who's best and whoever's best is supposed to get 
the most points - except in this case, the points are called "money".</p>

<p>Now, imagine that if you have enough points, you can spend some of your points to change the rules for how points are scored. </p>

<p>Earning points by actually playing games is good, because we want 
people to be playing the games, because this is a video game tournament.
 </p>

<p>Likewise, making money by actually making cool things and selling 
them to people at reasonable rates is good, because we want people to be
 making cool things, and we want people to be able to buy them at 
reasonable rates.</p>

<p>But sometimes you can find ways of earning points that have nothing 
to do with making cool stuff, and instead have to do with the fact that 
the people with the most points get to influence how the tournament is 
run. This is bad. </p>

<p>Likewise, sometimes you can find ways of earning money that involves 
messing with other people's attempts to make money, so that you can even
 move in and take their money. And if you can spend money on deciding 
what people call 'good' and 'bad', you can even get other people to say 
that you're doing the right thing.</p>

<p>If you can spend ENOUGH money, you can even convince everyone that 
it's actually the guys down at the bottom that are stealing all the 
money, instead of realizing that it's actually just you, messing with 
the scoring system.</p>

<p>Did that help?</p>

<p>TLDR: Economic rent is when a company finds a way to make "free 
money" by forcing something to be more difficult for its competitors 
than it ought to be - for example, by creating absurd DRM-based 
copyright laws, or by lobbying for subsidies on one side and tariffs on 
the other, or by using market position to coerce suppliers into not 
dealing with competitors, or by gaining "exclusive rights" to a 
particular resource or process.</p>

<p>It's the economic equivalent of elbowing your opponent in an arcade 
fighting game to break his groove, instead of learning to combo better -
 or of only accepting challenges from opponents you know you can beat, 
and refusing to give up your spot until one of them beats you.</p>

<p>One thing I'd like to say, is that I'm coming from a very different 
set of assumptions than you seem to be. Here's what I'm working with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modern MMORPGs got Roles right. Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast even 
acknowledged this with 4th edition of D&amp;D, by directly stealing 
those Roles from MMORPGs into their tabletop collaborative dungeon-crawl
 game. Here are the Roles you need to have if you're going to make a 
co-op dungeon crawl work:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><p>Attack - these are the guys that kill the baddies; in your 
example, the "sword guy" is an Attack role. Attack role characters are 
often called "Strikers" or "Blasters" or "DPS".</p></li>
<li><p>Defense - these are your defensive line; in your example, the 
"shield guy" is a Defense role. Defenders are often called "Tanks".</p></li>
<li><p>Control - these guys make sure that the enemy can't gang up too 
hard on the Defenders, or break past the Defenders to get to the squishy
 Supporters and Attackers (or worse, the Controllers themselves). 
Sometimes called "Herders" or "Mob managers" or "Crowd control".</p></li>
<li><p>Support- these make sure that everyone else can do their job 
effectively, usually by providing bonuses, healing damage, and undoing 
negative conditions. Often called "Healers" or "Leaders"; this can be 
the hardest role to play.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, here's a vitally important thing:</p>

<p>EVERYONE should be capable of performing more than their own role. 
Everyone should have one role that they excel in, that they shine in, 
that everything is going amazingly well while they are doing. But 
everyone also needs to have at least one fallback role that they can 
fill if they need to, in case the primary person filling that role falls
 down when the RNG gets cranky.</p>

<p>Here are specific Role patterns that most people intuitively "get", because games have been using them for decades:</p>

<p>Warrior - primary Attack, secondary Defense
Archer - Primary Attack, secondary Control
Knight - primary Defense, secondary Attack
Paladin - primary Defense, secondary Support
Wizard - primary Control, secondary Support
Thief - primary Control, secondary Attack
Priest - primary Support, secondary Defense
Bard - primary Support, secondary Control</p>

<ul>
<li>Equipment and level building are one of the easiest and most 
intuitive ways for players to customize their characters. Without a way 
to invest in your character, you don't "own" it. Players need clear ways
 to invest in and personalize their characters.</li>

 see a lot of the same problems in cultures without polygyny, though - 
for example, American low-income urban culture, where you have a class 
of "unweddable" males <em>and</em> a class of unwed females.</p>

<p>The 'unweddable' males are not caused by polygyny; for the most part 
they merely correlate. What's actually causative is a particular kind of
 cultural machismo that sets males in constant competition with each 
other, and only considers the top N% performers to be worthwhile human 
beings, while the rest are expendable.</p>

<p>That happens independent of polygamy in a causative sense, although 
in practice cultures that support polygyny also tend to support those 
competitive hierarchies.</p>

<p>The real solution is to find a way to break the stranglehold that 
various forms of power elite continue to enforce on the rest of us, by 
dissolving artificial resource scarcities. </p>

<p>You're describing polygyny, not polygamy-in-general. In the situation
 you're describing, it's not polygamy that's the problem, it's gender 
disparity. Educate and empower women and you solve that problem right 
fast.</p>

<p>That's what I'm discussing - and the uptick in STD's is solvable if people stop being prudish about prophylactic protection.</p>

<p>I've tried that, but I've discovered that I typically do not have the

incorrectly) generalized this to "if you enjoy something, you will not 
have the power to pursue it, so don't pursue anything that you enjoy",
