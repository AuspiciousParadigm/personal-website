I was also dating (PERSON 2)... By the time (PERSON 1) and I were dating... That doesn't excuse my behavior with (PERSON 1) at all... I just want to make it clear that my acknowledgement that I f**d up bad with (PERSON 1) doesn't imply that I feel equally culpable with (PERSON 2). This doesn't meant that I don't feel culpable. (PERSON 2) and I hurt each other, a lot... While (PERSON 2) and I were dating...
first comment is referring to the relationship with (PERSON 2) discussed here
second comment and subcomment are from a different person as made the first comment and are confirming that (PERSON 2) physically struck Brent (which I think was mentioned in the Medium post), the person they refer to as being able to back it up is the first commenter
also, as a potentially relevant clarification, the first commenter was I believe themselves romantically involved with (PERSON 2) at one point
I would ideally like to post the original allegations from (PERSON 1) on FB, but it looks like they might have deleted their account
(PERSON 1) had originally made a FB post in January
