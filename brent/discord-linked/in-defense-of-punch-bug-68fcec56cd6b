There’s some regional variation in rulesets, but at its core the game is simple: if you see a Volkswagen beetle, you get to punch the person next to you, and they can’t punch you back.</p><figure name="3604" id="3604" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 434px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 62.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Y1oG84kxPeAkW0Ty1lI5ew.jpeg" data-width="725" data-height="450" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*Y1oG84kxPeAkW0Ty1lI5ew.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Y1oG84kxPeAkW0Ty1lI5ew.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="4caa" id="4caa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I’ve played this game nonstop since grade school. I’m currently a 32-year-old man living in a liberal coastal city, and when, out of sheer reflex, I gently tap a friend on the arm and say “blue punch bug, no punch back,” the response I often get back is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">moral outrage.</em></p><p name="8eec" id="8eec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not just “eh, that’s immature.” Not just “oh, right, that game—uh, I prefer not to be punched, even gently.” Not even “hey, screw you, asshole, don’t touch me,” but rather actual moral outrage that reaches far beyond the immediate interaction and into deep, fundamental values. I hear sentences like “yeah, so—the whole point of that game is violence and violating other people’s personal sovereignty and it’s coercive and vaguely rapey and a symbol of everything that’s fucked up about our culture and I wish it didn’t exist.”</p><p name="6618" id="6618" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">ó_Ò</p><p name="3b3d" id="3b3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This doesn’t happen all the time. But it does happen maybe twenty to forty percent of the time. If I try to play punch bug with ten new people this month (or even just raise the possibility), I can expect <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">three real, actual human beings </em>to have a reaction that’s approximately that strong.</p><p name="f593" id="f593" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And sure, one response might be to dismiss that as a symptom of over-the-top coastal liberalism and just chalk it up to social justice culture, or whatever.</p><p name="0df1" id="0df1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the thing is, those three-or-four-out-of-ten people are <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">smart.</em> More than that, they’re <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">good.</em> These are, generally, people whose deep character I admire a lot, who are trying to make the world a better place and who usually think pretty carefully as they do so. They’re people who routinely have insights that surprise me and lead me to update my view of the world and change my own behavior. They are not a group I am able or willing to dismiss.</p><p name="497d" id="497d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That being said, I think that their stance on punch bug is Actually, Importantly Incorrect, and I <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">separately</em> think that their overall strategy for making our society better is taking them dangerously close to a cliff, and I think I see a link between these two phenomena that leads me to believe that I can use one as a metaphor to talk about the other. In this essay, I’d like to try to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">convince</em> those people that, far from being evil, the game of punch bug brings something critical to our society—something that the liberal zeitgeist (at least) has been losing track of<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">,</em> to the detriment of ourselves and our society.</p><p name="cba8" id="cba8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You know those three-dimensional plastic puzzles, where you have to hold ten or twenty (or a hundred) little pieces in exactly the right orientation as you squeeze the last, keystone piece into place? To me, this feels a lot like that—there are a whole bunch of sub-concepts and premises and hypotheses that don’t necessarily hold water on their own, but which I find make a pretty reasonable web once they all fall into place next to one another. Some of them act as explicit premises in an argument, while others just <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">feel important</em> as part of the background even though they don’t visibly tie in.</p><p name="6da8" id="6da8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So the request is something like “bear with me” as I throw a bunch of balls in the air, some of which may at first seem under-justified or utterly unrelated to one another. This piece is much more conversational and stream-of-thought than most, because I’m trying to download an entire context rather than a single point. And that means I need a little more charity than usual—I don’t want you to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">ignore</em> your doubts or confusions or disagreements as they arise, but I would ask you to deliberately hold them in abeyance until the end and not give up on the whole piece the first time some part of it pisses you off or seems obviously wrong. By the end, I predict that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">some</em> of those disagreements will still be live, and some of those fights will still be worth having, but some of them will be zombies staggering around out of habit or reflex or momentum with no remaining life of their own.</p><p name="ed8f" id="ed8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This one’s long because I’m trying to be careful, and I’m trying to be clear.</p></div></div></section><section name="9847" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="c316" id="c316" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Part 1: Background models</h3><p name="bb5c" id="bb5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Model 1 (of 4): Burden of Proof<br></strong>There’s this interesting dynamic whereby big important disagreements often contain a hidden <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">meta</em> disagreement around <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">how the question at hand should even be settled.</em> It turns out that people who strongly disagree on the object level also often strongly disagree on what even counts as “evidence” or “reasoning,” or which sacred principles should trump which other sacred principles. For instance, the religion-versus-atheism debate often gets derailed before it even starts because one side thinks <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">you’re allowed to believe anything until there’s specific reason not to </em>(and that faith-without-proof is a virtue), and the other side thinks <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">you can’t believe anything unless there’s specific reason to </em>(and that faith-without-proof is a sin), and that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">underlying</em> disagreement rarely gets hashed out first, or even acknowledged. Neither side will ever convince the other because neither side agrees on <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what constitutes validity. </em>They’re talking past each other, not having the same conversation.</p><p name="085f" id="085f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a second example, take the debate over corporal punishment of children. One side generally argues a sort of history-based, evolved-equilibrium stance in which spankings are how children have been disciplined for millennia, and anyone proposing an alternative system <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">bears the burden of proof</em> for demonstrating that that alternative system is both better for kids <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">and</em> doesn’t contain any critical failure modes that the traditional system has covered (“if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”).</p><p name="dd9a" id="dd9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the same time, though, the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">other</em> side of the debate typically starts from a position that goes something like, personal sovereignty is good, violence is bad, and human societies get things wrong all the time; the right way to make decisions is not by assuming that our older, crueler, less-enlightened ancestors got it right but rather by starting from first principles and carefully thinking things through. Therefore, anyone arguing in favor of spankings <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">bears the burden of proof</em> for demonstrating that the benefits outweigh the obvious cost of violating some very fundamental principles of nonviolence and respect for the personal sovereignty of other people.</p><p name="aedb" id="aedb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This means that both sides will fail to meet the “bar” of the other, because there’s no clear, common-knowledge understanding of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">who bears the burden of proof. </em>Both sides think they’re playing the easier game of defense—they <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">each</em> think of themselves as the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">default,</em> and expect the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">other</em> side to create an airtight, compelling argument for why we should make an extraordinary effort to restructure what they see as current social norms, and so they <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">both</em> walk home justifiably smug at how the other side failed to come even close to proving their case.</p></div></div></section><section name="b1a8" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="3a5b" id="3a5b" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Model 2: Pendulums<br></strong>One of my favorite quick-and-dirty models of social change is the mental image of a pendulum swinging back and forth around a central resting point.</p><p name="176a" id="176a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine that the pendulum is “stuck” at some point (say, that marriages are viewed as essentially inviolable, and divorce is tantamount to social suicide).

But that new stuck point comes with its own problems. For instance, maybe we’ve traded “lots of people trapped in marriages that are net-negative” for “lots of people who never reap the benefits of what <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">would</em> have been strongly net-positive relationships, because they were implicitly encouraged to bail early on when they hit the first obstacle or stumbling block.”</p><p name="e625" id="e625" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The latter problem is clearly smaller, and is probably a better problem to have as an individual, but it’s nevertheless clear (to me, anyway) that the loosening of the absoluteness of marriage had negative effects <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">in addition to</em> the positive ones. And it seems to me that this is nearly always the case.</p><p name="7b80" id="7b80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(Caveat: don’t let the simplicity of the model obscure the complexities of real life … in reality, the “pendulum” isn’t just swinging back and forth, or even around in spirals, but on a whole <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">bunch</em> of different dimensions all at once. It’s not just “this one thing got better, but meanwhile this other thing got worse” or “this one problem got solved, but meanwhile this new problem got created.” There are usually <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">many</em> ways in which a given shift is better, and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">many</em> ways in which it’s still bad or newly problematic.

I never got that. I tried, I even dropped some hints, like “Maybe this reminds you of your father?” or “Maybe you feel like screaming at me right now?” but they never took the bait.

And the more I examine this, the more I realize that my results are pretty atypical for psychiatrists. There’s something I’m doing — totally by accident — to produce those results.

Person A finds themselves telling the story of how this happened <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">because of Person B,</em> often with a hidden assumption that there was some sort of personal defection (malice, selfishness, callousness, manipulation, reckless ignorance or inattention).

First off, privilege is a thing that exists, and we don’t just mean in terms of race and wealth. When you take into account stuff like neurodiversity and the wide space of disease and disability and the social contexts people grow up in and so on and so forth, there are a <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">lot</strong> of ways that a person can be weakened or disadvantaged that other people might not notice or know about or know to validate.</blockquote><blockquote name="f190" id="f190" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Second, every life has moral weight and value. Sure, some people are better than others in a utilitarian sense.

Often, you’ll have to work hard to create conditions of safety, and even then you’ll want to actively check in with people rather than thinking that silence is consent and no news is good news. You’d be surprised at how much people will bear without complaint, especially if past experience has trained them that they’ll be ignored (or punished!) if they speak up.</blockquote><blockquote name="af99" id="af99" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Second, <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">take action</strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">.</em> When you discover that your actions are creating negative impact on other people, don’t just brush them off with empty words. Put your money where your mouth is—<strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">especially</strong> if you have extra flexibility as a result of personal privilege. A little bit of conscious effort on your part can often prevent or ameliorate repeated and cumulative damage to someone else.

It has a specific and technical meaning in biology, but if we broaden the term and use it as a metaphor, we can see that it shows up in a lot of places. Bones and muscles are subject to a hormetic process—abuse them too much and they degrade, abuse them too little and they atrophy, but abuse them just the right amount and they’ll repair themselves stronger and stronger. The human immune system is hormetic, as well—a major player in the rise of pervasive allergic and autoimmune disorders is the fact that a lot of people grow up <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">too clean</em> these days.</p><figure name="fd1e" id="fd1e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 371px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 53%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*yWBd3BJIP7F-otcEpeBhMA.png" data-width="2150" data-height="1139" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*yWBd3BJIP7F-otcEpeBhMA.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*yWBd3BJIP7F-otcEpeBhMA.png"></div></figure><p name="5333" id="5333" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">And I suspect that human emotional well-being is similarly dominated by a hormetic effect.

It’s just that they <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">matter</em> less. They don’t receive “event” status in the mind of the person experiencing them. In the fashion of exposure therapy, punch bug teaches you that no great or lasting hurt will come from a couple of punches on the arm, that the small betrayal of a sneak attack from your friend isn’t predictive of any larger, more meaningful betrayals, and that impotence (in the form of being unable to hit back) is often temporary and either way survivable. It gives your trauma-detectors a set-point of ordinariness so that events of magnitude one- or two- or three-out-of-ten <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">don’t</em> trigger narrative catastrophizing and massive amounts of stress, anxiety, or desperate-need-to-act.</p><p name="a16f" id="a16f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(As for the last one, it even teaches <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">patience.</em> That parked bug you passed on the way to school might be there on the way home—be ready.)</p><p name="d37d" id="d37d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a clear and obvious objection, in the form of “you only think that level of violence and harm is good because you’re accustomed to it, and in a more perfect future society where harm is an order of magnitude rarer, you would correctly identify this as awful.”</p><p name="54a5" id="54a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here’s the thing: regardless of whether we’ll get to that world eventually and what might or might not be considered good once we’re in it, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">we’re not there yet.</em></p><p name="3136" id="3136" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is another reason why I find punch bug and similar activities to be an important part of the human experience. The level of sovereignty that the anti-punch-bug crowd is trying to force into being simply <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">isn’t supported</em> by reality yet. You absolutely <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">will</em> have intrusions upon your experience on the level of random punches on the arm. In school, there are bullies and pop quizzes and the random acts of capricious teachers; in adulthood these are replaced by shitty coworkers and horrible bosses and inexplicable twinges in your back, not to mention penalty fees, stubbed toes, car accidents, cheating romantic partners, and cancer.</p><p name="0ba7" id="0ba7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yes, the ideal that the anti-punch-bug crowd is striving for is the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">right</em> ideal; I’d like nothing more than to be able to tell my future child “you will be in control of your body and your destiny once we’ve finished making you learn the basics.” But it’s not <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">true.</em> And given that it’s not true, I’d rather provide them with opportunities to learn the valuable skills of rising above small adversities, dealing with small hurts, and learning to take one’s experiences and one’s emotional responses as object, rather than being subject <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">to</em> them. Punch bug is a sandbox for kids to practice the kind of emotional resilience, intelligence, and maturity that they’ll <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">need,</em> come middle and high school.</p><p name="e80d" id="e80d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(There’s also something in there about the power of context and narrative, like how most of us find action movies enjoyable and threatening social situations unpleasant even though the physiological sensations of each might well be identical.
